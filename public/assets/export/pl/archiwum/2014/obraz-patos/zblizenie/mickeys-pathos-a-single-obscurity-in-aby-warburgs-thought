However, in their extreme externalization of emotions, animation of the inorganic and delirious commotion, these films are compelling cultural objects for&nbsp;thinking through&nbsp;Warburg’s notions of <em>Nachleben</em>, <em>Pathosformeln</em> and accessory forms in motion. If, as Warburg claims, such impulses erupt in times of deep social and psychological crisis, then 1929 is a&nbsp;case in point. Not to mention the social and political unrest and the worldwide economic depression, the frenzied unrest of these films is symptomatic of modernity’s struggle to come to terms with&nbsp;an environment increasingly animated by technology, as well as with&nbsp;the progressive mechanization of society itself –&nbsp;“the perturbed world,” as Disney describes it above&nbsp;–&nbsp;a&nbsp;time of crisis if ever there was one. Moreover, as the above&nbsp;quotes show, both Disney and Warburg departed from&nbsp;an interconnected notion of creative expression through&nbsp;time, space and medium, lending us the perhaps superfluous license or in any case the conceptual basis to write this&nbsp;missing chapter, as it were –&nbsp;this&nbsp;“one single obscurity.” In so doing, rather than&nbsp;apply Warburg’s theories to Disney’s films, I&nbsp;aim to investigate the significance of relating the two, submitting both to critical consideration. This&nbsp;follows from&nbsp;the central question: what are the implications of Aby Warburg's notions on <em>Nachleben</em>, <em>Pathosformeln</em> and <em>Empathie</em><sup><a href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc">4</a></sup><em></em>in thinking about&nbsp;the significance of early Disney animation as a&nbsp;cultural object and how is this&nbsp;significant in understanding both the nature of the crisis of modernity and the broader psycho-anthropological ramifications of Warburg's thought?</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="m-page-content m-page-content--video m-page-content--video-right">   <div class="c-article-video">    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">     <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/saM-F9HjGGo?rel=0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>    </div>    <div class="c-article-video__caption"><p>Walt Disney, <em> Gallopin Gaucho</em>, (1928)</p></div>   </div>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>In pursuing this, a&nbsp;selection of Warburg’s texts will be central, most notably his essay entitled <em>A Lecture on the Serpent Ritual</em> (1923), in which his ideas on 'pathos-formulas' and empathy allow for&nbsp;an in-depth consideration of the notion of <em>Nachleben</em> in relation to Disney’s films and for&nbsp;its elucidation of these terms within&nbsp;a&nbsp;broader understanding of cultural expression, that&nbsp;is beyond&nbsp;the framework of European so-called high art.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc">5</a></sup> Although the Disney enterprise may arguably be perceived as both commercial and trivial because of its concessions to the market and its moralist-didactic realism, these animations were part of the radical experimental vanguard at the time and featured prominently within&nbsp;contemporary modernist rhetoric. Within&nbsp;this context, Esther Leslie’s <em>Hollywood Flatlands</em> and Walter Benjamin’s fragmentary writings on Mickey Mouse as a&nbsp;compelling locus of animadversion are central in pinpointing the significance of relating Warburg to early animation and vice versa. Leslie offers not only a&nbsp;very perceptive insight into&nbsp;the cultural significance of early Disney animation, she also builds a&nbsp;peculiar bridge between&nbsp;Warburg and animation; between&nbsp;the lines this&nbsp;publication is replete with&nbsp;Warburgian language, though she never mentions him explicitly.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc">6</a></sup> Though Leslie’s perspective is a&nbsp;markedly neo-Marxist one, I&nbsp;will reconfigure her analysis into&nbsp;a&nbsp;less political and more psycho-pathological understanding of the films.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc">7</a></sup> Arguably, her notions become somewhat limited within&nbsp;this specific, historically-determined framework and will gain greater potential if seen alongside more psychologically-determined, trans-historical lines –&nbsp;already, albeit only latently present.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="m-page-content m-page-content--video m-page-content--video-right">   <div class="c-article-video">    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">     <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h03QBNVwX8Q?rel=0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>    </div>    <div class="c-article-video__caption"><p>Walt Disney, <em> Gallopin Gaucho</em>, (1928)</p></div>   </div>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>In his later essays, Aby Warburg developed his notions of <em>Nachleben</em> to encompass a&nbsp;broader understanding of the significance of his initial, more empirically-grounded findings, particularly by pursuing the question of what interested artists when they turned to antiquity for&nbsp;a&nbsp;model.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc">8</a></sup> In these later phases of his thought, the notion of <em>Nachleben</em> became inextricably bound to that&nbsp;of pathos-formulas and empathy. How may these notions help in grasping the cultural significance of Walt Disney’s very first animations?<sup><a href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc">9</a></sup> The conventions of commerce having not yet set in, these films manifest a&nbsp;radical play with&nbsp;animation –&nbsp;a&nbsp;medium that, by its very definition, not only invites an in-depth consideration of Warburg’s lifelong engagement with&nbsp;movement, but&nbsp;also allows his concern with&nbsp;“the most difficult problem in all art, which is that&nbsp;of capturing images of life in motion,” to gain new significance.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc">10</a></sup></p> <p>Warburg himself was not in the least interested in animation and was indeed quite unimpressed by what he described as logical, technologized modern man, who, as opposed to magical man (situated on the opposite&nbsp;pole) had “acquired the sense of technical security of the European who awaits the future event as something bound to occur according to an organic or mechanical law.”<sup><a href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc">11</a></sup> Here Warburg was mistaken, as he apparently failed to grasp the dramatic consequences of technology for&nbsp;modern man who by no means felt secure, but&nbsp;rather intensely struggled to come to grips with&nbsp;a&nbsp;drastically altered environment and his own mechanized motions within&nbsp;it. Indeed, <em>Plane Crazy </em>“mustered all the lunacy of technologized modernity” and none of its alleged logic or technological security.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc">12</a></sup> Of course, as with&nbsp;his rather conventional attitude towards&nbsp;the more innovative styles of modern art and the fact that&nbsp;he overlooked the immense cultural significance of animation and cinema, these blind-spots can easily be excused as a&nbsp;difference in interest and a&nbsp;rather innocent instance of what, on a&nbsp;jovial note, could be characterized as ‘old-man’s blinkers’. More importantly however, Warburg failed to grasp the value of his own ideas for&nbsp;understanding animation as a&nbsp;cultural object, that&nbsp;is, as an object that&nbsp;permitted a&nbsp;negotiation of anxieties and, as I&nbsp;will show, functioned not unlike&nbsp;the antelope-masks or serpents for&nbsp;the Hopi, one of the Native American tribes visited by Warburg in 1895. Very probably, though speculatively, should Warburg have acknowledged that&nbsp;modern man was by no means tranquil, secure, or logical, but&nbsp;rather distressed and restless, he might have recognised the fruitfulness of considering&nbsp;animation as a&nbsp;locus of negotiation and indeed a&nbsp;support to his claims about&nbsp;the function of art and the broader creation of images as necessary to human survival.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2639-1-pb-1920x-349.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2639-1-pb-330x-8ae.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2639-1-pb-660x-fe3.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2639-1-pb-768x-46f.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2639-1-pb-1320x-802.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2639-1-pb-660x-fe3.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Fig. 1.

As Jay P.

In servitude of Mickey’s needs, a&nbsp;dog transforms into&nbsp;a&nbsp;staircase (Fig.1) and later into&nbsp;a&nbsp;wind-up motor to start-up the plane (Fig.2). Likewise, in <em>Gallopin Gaucho</em>, Mickey solves all practical problems by turning mechanical. So when he is unable to open the door to the tower where Minnie is kept captive, he simply extends his tail into&nbsp;a&nbsp;lasso, connects a&nbsp;turning-handle to a&nbsp;hole with&nbsp;which he now appears to be equipped, and winds himself up to the top window (Fig.3-4). And when he and Minnie struggle to kiss on a&nbsp;bumpy ostrich-ride (Fig.5), they simply coil up their tails to facilitate a&nbsp;well-levelled embrace (Fig.6).Though we are now well acquainted with&nbsp;and thereby perhaps unimpressed by such metamorphoses, in the 1920s, as aptly put in Leslie’s eloquent prose: “Modernist theorists and artists were fascinated by cartoons”, particularly “…proponents of a&nbsp;demotic modernism that&nbsp;was… ever curious about&nbsp;the shadow side, the mass market of industrialized culture. For&nbsp;the modernists, cartoons –&nbsp;which rebuff so ferociously painterly realism and filmic naturalism –&nbsp;are set inside&nbsp;a&nbsp;universe of transformation, overturning and provisionality.”<sup><a href="#sdfootnote17sym" name="sdfootnote17anc">17</a></sup> Walter Benjamin, for&nbsp;instance, did not fail to see the significance of early animation and wrote extensively on it.

Mickey and his friends’ mimic transfigurations into&nbsp;mechanical forms parallel the Hopi’s mutations into&nbsp;their prey –&nbsp;both transform into&nbsp;that which they aim to command. According to Warburg, it is in this&nbsp;midway between&nbsp;logic and magic that&nbsp;man “interposes symbols between&nbsp;himself and the world” in order to “coerce the hostile forces of nature."<sup><a href="#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc">19</a></sup> In fact, Leslie quite literally echoes this&nbsp;thought: “Through a&nbsp;grim and <em>mimetic</em> humour, Disney provides a&nbsp;safe haven from&nbsp;daily collective experience –&nbsp;the threats of urban life, the mad and lively and overwhelming machines, the cars, the steel foundries, the punch-ups."<sup><a href="#sdfootnote20sym" name="sdfootnote20anc">20</a></sup> Of course, by no means did Warburg understand such mimetic transformations as ‘safe,’ let alone capable of offering any kind of 'haven' and on this&nbsp;specific point Leslie shows an overly optimistic understanding of the films’ workings.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote21sym" name="sdfootnote21anc">21</a></sup> It is, in fact, often claimed that&nbsp;such cyborg-like hybridity as that&nbsp;which is embodied in Disney’s figures is “…a product of cultural fears and desires that&nbsp;run deep within&nbsp;our psychic unconscious.”<sup><a href="#sdfootnote22sym" name="sdfootnote22anc">22</a></sup> Regardless, Leslie’s statement does indicate that&nbsp;such animations offered a&nbsp;certain distance, a&nbsp;<em>Denkraum</em> –&nbsp;thereby becoming negotiating symbols between&nbsp;man and his environment. Such symbols, Warburg writes, become “a hieroglyph… something to be read -&nbsp;an intermediary stage between&nbsp;image and sign, between&nbsp;realistic representation and script,” or put differently: a&nbsp;“fairy-tale-like way of thinking.”<sup><a href="#sdfootnote23sym" name="sdfootnote23anc">23</a></sup></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2647-1-pb-1920x-7f7.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2647-1-pb-330x-ef2.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2647-1-pb-660x-664.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2647-1-pb-768x-390.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2647-1-pb-1320x-272.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2647-1-pb-660x-664.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Fig. 6.

As Gertrud Bing formulates it, pathos-formulas are “to be considered as visible expressions of psychic states that&nbsp;had become fossilized, so to speak, in the images.”<sup><a href="#sdfootnote24sym" name="sdfootnote24anc">24</a></sup> Georges Didi-Huberman insists that&nbsp;this should not be understood in semiotic terms, but&nbsp;rather as a&nbsp;psychic symptomatology and goes on to offer an elaborate explanation of the symptom –&nbsp;that&nbsp;which links Warburg to Sigmund Freud. Briefly, the symptom accounts “simultaneously for&nbsp;repression and the return of the repressed,” hence its dialectic nature as grounded in Freud’s polar theory of culture.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote25sym" name="sdfootnote25anc">25</a></sup> Pathos-formulas, then, are “corporeal crystallizations” of this&nbsp;dialectic.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote26sym" name="sdfootnote26anc">26</a></sup> It is here that&nbsp;it becomes clear how <em>Nachleben</em> is related to pathos-formulas, the latter being the expression, in times of crisis, of the afterlife of trauma, thereby seeking to find some sort of arbitration between&nbsp;magical defence and rational control-mechanisms Nietzsche’s Dionysian-Apollonian dialectic. Moreover, the distance resulting from&nbsp;the creation of a&nbsp;symbol can result in the formation of a&nbsp;<em>Denkraum</em> –&nbsp;as produced by art and culture –&nbsp;a&nbsp;space for&nbsp;the mediation of this&nbsp;dialectic.

Whereas both the main characters, the animals and even the environment itself seem malleable to whatever situation –&nbsp;the cow’s tail is extended into&nbsp;its neck to allow Mickey to hop onto&nbsp;the plane (Fig.8) and even the church-tower automatically contracts to allow the crazed plane to fly over&nbsp;(Fig.9) –&nbsp;in Disney’s world the sole element that&nbsp;fully defies control is the plane itself.

Mickey’s ears jump from&nbsp;his head when he is frightened (Fig.13), his teeth jump out to catch a&nbsp;cigarette (Fig.14) and he snatches his opponents’ bellybutton –&nbsp;now a&nbsp;ring –&nbsp;to slap it back on after&nbsp;play (Fig.15). According to Leslie, nature and life are reduced to accessories in what Benjamin understood to be a&nbsp;loss of self: “the cartoons make clear that&nbsp;even our bodies do not belong to us” and are thereby “…object lessons in the actuality of alienation… impoverished experience” and dehumanization.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote40sym" name="sdfootnote40anc">40</a></sup> However, Disney and Benjamin were not so melancholic (in the case of Benjamin, not yet) or nostalgic in the face of technology. Both saw the need to rework and influence rather than&nbsp;to oppose new developments. Benjamin formulates the mood of cartoons best in remarking that&nbsp;“the laughter that&nbsp;these films provoke hovers over&nbsp;an abyss of horror.”<sup><a href="#sdfootnote41sym" name="sdfootnote41anc">41</a></sup> In this&nbsp;sense, the films are not so much a&nbsp;passive complaint, but&nbsp;rather a&nbsp;cathartic impulse in acting out fears and may therefore alternatively be understood as transitional cultural objects in negotiating man’s new relationship to a&nbsp;dominating technologized environment. And though Warburg asserts that&nbsp;the “comical… obstructs the insight into&nbsp;the tragic element,” I&nbsp;would propose that&nbsp;the tragicomic nature of Disney’s earliest animations are precisely what characterized the inter-war period’s struggle with&nbsp;technology.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2678-1-pb-1920x-e5b.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2678-1-pb-330x-9d9.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2678-1-pb-660x-6c3.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2678-1-pb-768x-b56.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2678-1-pb-1320x-309.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2678-1-pb-660x-6c3.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Fig. 14.

Though, as I&nbsp;have demonstrated, the films are replete with&nbsp;anxiety, albeit a&nbsp;humorously-tinted one, the overall frenzy may perhaps be too overly Dionysian to be fruitful in negotiating modernity’s fears and indeed, there is much pleasure to be found in their letting things get completely out of hand. Ultimately, Disney soon went on to kneel to the commercial demands for&nbsp;happy-go-lucky blockbusters, dictated by cheap moralism and realistic laws of physics. In fact, as critical theorists disappointedly acknowledged, all of cinema failed by failing “to escape the grip of tradition,”<sup><a href="#sdfootnote42sym" name="sdfootnote42anc">42</a></sup> But&nbsp;in those brief early years of experimentation with&nbsp;the new medium of animation, Disney created a&nbsp;few films that&nbsp;were geared to rework, negotiate and allow modern man to gain agency in his problematic relationship to a&nbsp;rapidly changing, animated, mechanized world. As such, they can be deemed radically innovative transitional cultural objects, in many ways comparable to those of the Hopi as described by Warburg. Indeed, animation was an ideal medium, one that&nbsp;“effectively invited our own ‘vicarious participation in the ritual of incarnation,’ in endowing something with&nbsp;life –&nbsp;literally animating it.”<sup><a href="#sdfootnote43sym" name="sdfootnote43anc">43</a></sup> It may be peculiar that&nbsp;Warburg did not recognize this, but&nbsp;his theories are rich in concepts that&nbsp;are strikingly fruitful when thinking about&nbsp;the significance of animation as a&nbsp;cultural object. As Michaud rightly remarks, Warburg’s aesthetic of movement emerged in sync with&nbsp;the nascent cinema and he “opened art-history to the observation of bodies in motion at the very moment the first images capable of representing them became diffused.” Despite&nbsp;his obliviousness to the importance of moving image technologies, this&nbsp;may not have been a&nbsp;coincidence.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote44sym" name="sdfootnote44anc">44</a></sup></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2680-1-pb-1920x-c59.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2680-1-pb-330x-863.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2680-1-pb-660x-00c.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2680-1-pb-768x-8af.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2680-1-pb-1320x-f98.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2014/6/mickeys-pathos/178-2680-1-pb-660x-00c.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Fig. 15.

They have done so in a&nbsp;way that&nbsp;elucidates both why and how contemporary critical thinkers found it so full of potential and extending understanding from&nbsp;a&nbsp;more common politically-contextualised reading into&nbsp;a&nbsp;more trans-historical, psychological framework. Conversely, Disney’s animation has demanded a&nbsp;reconfiguration of Warburg’s concepts, which, despite&nbsp;his own recalcitrance, have proven sufficiently malleable to extend their relevance into&nbsp;this a&nbsp;context. The crisis of modernity being fundamentally different to that&nbsp;of earlier ages, it features a&nbsp;more tragicomic attitude towards&nbsp;its fate and manifests a&nbsp;more extreme fusion of substances and their behaviour. In it, man, machine, environment and nature all empathize with&nbsp;and behave like&nbsp;one another a&nbsp;quality made possible by the very medium of animation. Hence, it is through&nbsp;technological means that&nbsp;man’s relationship to technology is negotiated, in the same way that&nbsp;the symptom is simultaneously repression and the return of the repressed.</p> <p>Evidently, many issues remain unanswered or have been insufficiently addressed in this&nbsp;endeavour, most notably Benjamin’s Warburgian ventriloquism and the relation between&nbsp;Warburg’s ideas on accessory-forms in motion and their invasion of the body in modernist animation. What is evident, however, is that&nbsp;animation –&nbsp;endowing images with&nbsp;movement Warburg’s primary concern –&nbsp;summons his ideas to bear on it perhaps even more than&nbsp;other media. Unwilling as he may have been to engage with&nbsp;cinematic media and modern man in his own time, Warburg succeeded in creating a&nbsp;historical psychology that&nbsp;has led to, perhaps more than&nbsp;he would have wanted, an extended after-life of his thought. Concrete, yet flexible, Warburg’s ideas remain fertile ground.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div>

Sergei Eisentein’s far more extensive preoccupation with Disney has not been included for consideration here, for two reasons. Firstly, his writings on Disney are mostly from 1941 – more than a decade after the first animations were released and thus largely shaped by hindsight, most notably regarding Disney’s incorporation into Hollywood and the capitalist culture industry. Secondly, his perspective, like Leslie’s, is a markedly political and historical, which would lead the current enquiry away from its stated aim, that of articulating the broader psycho-anthropological ramifications of Warburg's thought, i.e. to reconfigure what is often understood as a historically-determined development into more trans-historical terms. Having said that, a critical comparison between Eisenstein’s writings on Disney and Warburg’s essay on the serpent ritual is very deserving of future research, specifically regarding Eisenstein’s notions on totemism and animism.

<p><a href="#sdfootnote44anc" name="sdfootnote44sym">44</a>Philippe-Alain Michaud, “Introduction” in <em>Aby Warburg and the Image in Motion</em> (New York: Zone Books, 2004), 39. In this introduction, Michaud sets forth his influential, though by no means uncontested insights into what he claims is Warburg’s montage-like way of thinking. Perhaps needless to explicate, Michaud’s notions have not been treated further here, because his concern is with the cinematic and specifically the montage-like qualities of Warburg’s methods. The current enquiry, by contrast, focusses on animation, which, as I hope to have shown, is significantly distinct from cinematography in that it consists of drawn, rather than recorded images, subsequently set in motion. It is precisely by virtue of this element, which is specific and unique to animation, that Warburg’s notions as treated above become so compelling.</p></div>
