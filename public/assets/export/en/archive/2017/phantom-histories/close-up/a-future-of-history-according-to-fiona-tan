This&nbsp;is not the question of a&nbsp;concept dealing with&nbsp;the past&nbsp;which might <em>already</em> be at our disposal or not at our disposal, <em>an archivable concept of the archive</em>. It is a&nbsp;question of the future, the question of the future itself, the question of a&nbsp;response, of a&nbsp;promise and of a&nbsp;responsibility for&nbsp;tomorrow. <br> Jacques Derrida, <em>Archive Fever <br><br></em></p> <p style="text-align: right;">- Remember? <br> -&nbsp;No, I&nbsp;don't remember, remember?<br> Fiona Tan, <em>History's Future<br><br></em></p> </blockquote> <p></p> <p>Reconstructing history from&nbsp;images and as an image for&nbsp;use in the present –&nbsp;for&nbsp;individual and communal life –&nbsp;is a&nbsp;task that&nbsp;I&nbsp;find in the works of the Dutch artist, documentary filmmaker, and director, Fiona Tan. The artist poses questions about&nbsp;where fiction lurks in facts, how one achieves self-awareness by thinking with&nbsp;and acting on images, how images express and modify ourselves, where we get our self-awareness from, and the certainty of being who we are –&nbsp;the ones who both have and make history. What is history as a&nbsp;common project, a&nbsp;project that&nbsp;I&nbsp;co-create as an agent, and that&nbsp;creates me as a&nbsp;subject? In this&nbsp;article, I&nbsp;will make an attempt to reconstruct the future of a&nbsp;certain (hi)story as imagined by Tan in <em>History's Future </em>(2016)<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a>, her first feature film. I&nbsp;will analyze it in relation to <em>May You Live in Interesting Times</em>, a&nbsp;television documentary from&nbsp;20 years earlier, in which the artist, starting from&nbsp;the history of her own family, takes her first steps across&nbsp;the minefield of memory and identity.</p> <p></p> <p>Organizator projektu <a href="http://bunkier.art.pl/?page_id=8096" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>„Trauma and Revival.

Her parents emigrated to Australia, where she grew up. She went to study in Amsterdam, where she lives and works until&nbsp;today. One of her most important recent exhibitions is <em>Geography of Time</em>, shown in 2016 and 2017 at the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and the National Museum in Oslo. On the occasion of the latter, the Norwegian Parliament presented her photographic project <em>Vox Populi Norway</em>, the first of a&nbsp;series of collective portraits of cities and countries created by the artist with&nbsp;the use of photographic matter gathered from&nbsp;the inhabitants.<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a></p> <p>One can locate an autobiographical foundation in virtually all of Fiona Tan's works. This, I&nbsp;would argue, grows out of the artist's sense of misplacement or displacement, either in the medium or in history, and from&nbsp;her ceaseless movement among&nbsp;people. It is the result of encounters with&nbsp;them and their histories, with&nbsp;histories people had been deprived of, which she finds in archives. I&nbsp;call this&nbsp;an emphatic autobiographical approach, in which the story of one's own life becomes a&nbsp;space for&nbsp;the lives of others, especially those whose "own" stories have been muted or erased. As such, it is a&nbsp;manifestation of relationality and multidirectional memory which, by creating critical, self-aware narratives about&nbsp;the past, courageously points to overlooked analogies and builds bridges between&nbsp;different experiences of oppression and violence; it is a&nbsp;project in which every encounter with&nbsp;the history of the other is an occasion for&nbsp;the transformation of one's own story.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a></p> <p>Fiona Tan attentively and patiently watches and listens to the voices and images of people –&nbsp;those they have created themselves and those that&nbsp;have been taken of them (often without&nbsp;their consent, often with&nbsp;violence), as well as to the histories of images that&nbsp;emerge and call for&nbsp;attention. One of her recent works is the video installation entitled <em>Nellie</em> (2013), a&nbsp;portrait of Cornelia van Rijn, Rembrandt's illegitimate daughter, who, at the age of 16, left the Netherlands for&nbsp;Batavia (today's Jakarta). Tan approaches this&nbsp;biography in a&nbsp;relational way, seeing it as a&nbsp;reflection of her own story: she tells the tale of the artist's daughter, a&nbsp;woman who chose an opposing path of emigration to Tan herself. A&nbsp;woman who, according to Tan's visual fantasy, led a&nbsp;lonely life far from&nbsp;the empire and her family.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7013-1-pb-1920x-a44.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7013-1-pb-330x-7f5.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7013-1-pb-660x-58d.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7013-1-pb-768x-686.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7013-1-pb-1320x-133.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7013-1-pb-660x-58d.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Fiona Tan, <em>May You Live in Interesting Times</em></p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>These images and stories would not have surfaced were it not for&nbsp;Fiona Tan's constant search of archives, and her scrutinizing of their aesthetics and politics (or the aesthetics of their politics).

The narrator of the film is the artist herself (as has already been said, the daughter of a&nbsp;Chinese father from&nbsp;Indonesia and an Australian mother with&nbsp;a&nbsp;Scottish background), who sets out on a&nbsp;journey to meet her roots, to visit her relatives, to look at them and talk to them. She is less than&nbsp;30 years old and struggling with&nbsp;a&nbsp;worrying sense of non-belonging, a&nbsp;lack of identity and lack of space or story in which to settle. Her expedition only intensifies this&nbsp;sense of detachment and makes her claim she is a&nbsp;"professional foreigner." Any attempt at self-definition fails. When she asks one of her relatives whether he considers her to be Chinese, and he answers yes, she suspects he does so out of politeness –&nbsp;the desire not to harm her or exclude her from&nbsp;the family. Tan realizes that&nbsp;her identity is determined by who she is not; however, her siblings find this&nbsp;condition liberating: being a&nbsp;riddle of sorts –&nbsp;one who does not "look" like&nbsp;an identifiable member of a&nbsp;group –&nbsp;can be comfortable and pleasant. When you are not immediately recognized, you can play with&nbsp;who you want to be. Identity is thus an infinite process of writing and overwriting the fragments of one's narrative, which often makes sense only after&nbsp;a&nbsp;while, belatedly.</p> <p>The camera examines the artist's face: where is that&nbsp;face from? Together with&nbsp;the narrator/protagonist we look at cupping and acupuncture therapy, a&nbsp;scene which distances us because Tan herself feels distant from&nbsp;the tradition that&nbsp;she is supposed to be part of. The question, then, is how to become part of a&nbsp;community by choice, and whether this&nbsp;community can claim us. Do we have the right to its past&nbsp;and pathos? Tan says that&nbsp;what began as a&nbsp;search turned into&nbsp;a&nbsp;search for&nbsp;the search itself. She hoped that&nbsp;filming would be a&nbsp;process that&nbsp;helped her identify her identity, to see herself as a&nbsp;part of a&nbsp;larger whole –&nbsp;a&nbsp;meaningful particle. Meanwhile, while searching, she realized not only that&nbsp;the search failed to point her in the right direction, but&nbsp;that the search itself remained suspicious: what was she actually looking for, penetrating the stories and images from&nbsp;her relatives' pasts and their places of origin?</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7009-1-pb-1920x-a44.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7009-1-pb-330x-7f5.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7009-1-pb-660x-58d.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7009-1-pb-768x-686.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7009-1-pb-1320x-133.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2017/18/przyszlosc-historii-wedlug-fiony-tan/529-7009-1-pb-660x-58d.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Fiona Tan, <em>May You Live in Interesting Times</em></p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>An important stage on her journey is Java, where Fiona Tan hopes to find out what it meant to be Chinese in Indonesia. She is particularly interested in the history of the persecution of the Chinese minority in 1965-1966, which affected her father's family.<a href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a> One of her paternal uncles still lives in Java; others are scattered around&nbsp;the world. In the film, the artist puts together photographs and documents, as well as a&nbsp;record of her meeting with&nbsp;her father's eldest living brother and his wife Rosa. Her aunt tells her that&nbsp;the people of the West called them "yellow Jews," excluded people without&nbsp;a&nbsp;home. The artist immediately grasps this&nbsp;theme and holds onto&nbsp;it, as if she had finally managed to get to the source of this&nbsp;inherited ambivalence, the legacy of paradoxes and fears.</p> <p>The family trauma associated with&nbsp;persecution and violence returns powerfully in a&nbsp;conversation with&nbsp;the artist's mother. In front of her daughter's camera she is only able to present a&nbsp;very emotionally modest narrative, to which the artist reacts with&nbsp;disappointment, demanding a&nbsp;more detailed and engaging story like&nbsp;the one she has already heard from&nbsp;her mother off-camera. Her mother, however, admits she does not feel comfortable sharing intimate details in public, as it might be painful for&nbsp;(or against&nbsp;the will of) Tan's father. She does not feel "authorized," and is clearly embarrassed by the presence of the camera –&nbsp;its mediation between&nbsp;her daughter and herself, as well as between&nbsp;herself and the past&nbsp;trauma. When the intimate is about&nbsp;to become public (and thus too vulnerable), the mother withdraws. Tan, on her part, decides to include this&nbsp;moment of crisis in the film, as further –&nbsp;perhaps the most poignant –&nbsp;proof not only of her problems with&nbsp;the past&nbsp;and belonging, but&nbsp;also with&nbsp;the passing of the narrative and the affective mediations of her own loss and non-belonging.</p> <p>"What do you feel when you look backwards?" Tan asks one of her aunts living in Europe. "I don't look back," she immediately responds. "I've always had a&nbsp;lot of children to take care of. They leave you no time to think about&nbsp;what was –&nbsp;you concentrate on what is and what will be. It was difficult, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't go back to it, it doesn't matter." Of course, Tan knows that&nbsp;it matters, as does the decision not to "go back," and she therefore includes this&nbsp;scene in the film. Even if we consciously leave the past&nbsp;behind, we are not able to eliminate its impact. By not looking back we cannot see the image that&nbsp;is behind&nbsp;us, but&nbsp;neither do we annihilate it –&nbsp;it does not cease to determine the shape of the images we produce. The dialectical thinking of the artist can clearly be seen in the example above: she shows that&nbsp;even if we decide to go back to what was –&nbsp;as she does when making the documentary –&nbsp;its meaning does not have to be revealed in an obvious, certain, or unambiguous way. Neither returning nor failing to return will save&nbsp;us; what matters is the sum of ideas, longing, desire, helplessness, and the urge for&nbsp;meaning.<br><br></p> <h2>Refugee from&nbsp;the Past</h2> <blockquote> <p style="text-align: right;">Emigration does not only involve leaving behind, crossing water, living amongst strangers, but, also, undoing the very meaning of the world and –&nbsp;at its most extreme –&nbsp;abandoning oneself to the most unreal which is the absurd.

The protagonist of the film is a&nbsp;man without&nbsp;memory. As the artist herself stated, she was inspired by the memory of reading a&nbsp;book she found in her mother's library, <em>The Man with&nbsp;a&nbsp;Shattered World</em> (1987),<a href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a> written by the famous Russian psychiatrist Alexander Luria, who analyzed cases of memory disorder. One of them involved a&nbsp;man who could not forget anything; another –&nbsp;a&nbsp;former soldier who, as the result of injury, lost not only his memory, but&nbsp;also language. A&nbsp;further experience that&nbsp;Tan evokes in the context of her early work on the film is her own work-related travel and witnessing of the world in crisis, looking at its various forms.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a></p> <p>The film opens with&nbsp;credits, then the lights go on in a&nbsp;movie theater and we see a&nbsp;man sleeping in a&nbsp;chair. Suddenly this&nbsp;frozen frame loses its stillness: everything starts to move, but&nbsp;backwards, as if time (and with&nbsp;it the picture and sound) had begun to run in the opposite&nbsp;direction. This&nbsp;is the first sign that&nbsp;the story will not be told conventionally, or will not even be "told" at all. This&nbsp;moment of surprise may set the paranoid imagination going, suggesting that&nbsp;something has gone wrong, something has broken down, and that, as spectators, we have lost the ground under&nbsp;our feet, found ourselves in crisis. And indeed, I&nbsp;think this&nbsp;is what the artist wanted us to face affectively –&nbsp;a&nbsp;sense of anxiety and recognition of the scenarios that&nbsp;we involuntarily activate in such a&nbsp;moment of crisis. But&nbsp;then all comes back on track, although the beginning of the film proper is another moment of rupture. As the result of physical assault, the protagonist experiences serious head injury and ends up in hospital with&nbsp;total memory loss; he knows neither his name nor history. He becomes an MP, a&nbsp;missing person, Mr. Nobody. As much as this&nbsp;experience involves suffering, it also turns out to be an opportunity to write one's story anew, to reject the past&nbsp;and present stored in personal and public archives. When, after&nbsp;a&nbsp;period of rehabilitation, no less confused and humiliated than&nbsp;after his accident, he returns home, he realizes momentarily that&nbsp;this is no "home." With&nbsp;no memories, no sense of attachment, or even ownership of what he should feel entitled to, he remains merely a&nbsp;screen onto&nbsp;which his life is projected. The life inscribed in the decor of his home or in photos from&nbsp;summer holidays is a&nbsp;ready-made –&nbsp;all he needs is to take it for&nbsp;granted. However, this&nbsp;ready-made is alien (if not repulsive) to him. All the bonds that&nbsp;would link him, or at least help him come back, have disintegrated. His wife –&nbsp;a&nbsp;stranger who is willing to help –&nbsp;only intensifies this&nbsp;sense of fiction when she tells him the reassuring story of a&nbsp;happy past&nbsp;illustrated with&nbsp;images of a&nbsp;common life, and projects the equally happy future awaiting them. He does not recognize this&nbsp;life as his own, to such an extent that&nbsp;when he accidentally ends up on the couch in his neighbors' living room, he feels "perfectly" at home there and fits the image.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a> Fiona Tan creates excellent, suggestive visual sequences, scenes, and faux<em>-</em>images –&nbsp;powerful language clichés which get to the heart of what is happening: the most fundamental crisis, the crisis of one's foundations.

The protagonist changes before&nbsp;our very eyes, becoming a&nbsp;lost vagrant, a&nbsp;cunning manipulator, a&nbsp;bon vivant involved in a&nbsp;romance, and a&nbsp;citizen lost in a&nbsp;political intrigue. The artist weaves unobvious (though highly suggestive) archival material into&nbsp;her film: Occupy movement footage; Arab Spring street protests; demonstrations on the streets of Spain and Greece; the wreck of the Costa Concordia; shots from&nbsp;shops where customers chase bargains; abandoned buildings; unfinished construction projects; and fragments of recorded conversations with&nbsp;people talking about&nbsp;their fears and hopes.<a href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a> We do not know what the relationship of these fragments is, nor do we know what they actually mean within&nbsp;the fabric of the plot.

Their incompatibility clarifies what it is they are supposed to "fit" into, and then to question the unquestioned nature of the way things are. The poster for&nbsp;<em>History's Future</em> shows the unclear, blurred face of the protagonist, a&nbsp;face that&nbsp;could not become a&nbsp;still or a&nbsp;portrait. I&nbsp;interpret this&nbsp;in the following&nbsp;way: this&nbsp;man not only lacks a&nbsp;single, distinct image, but&nbsp;the pictorial trace he leaves behind&nbsp;can only be blurred because we are dealing with&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional refugee from&nbsp;memory –&nbsp;a&nbsp;man with&nbsp;many possible futures. If, for&nbsp;T. S. Eliot, a&nbsp;man was a&nbsp;"heap of broken images" –&nbsp;and his poetry, <em>The Waste Land</em> specifically, seems to be an important point of reference in and inspiration for&nbsp;<em>History's Future</em> –&nbsp;in Tan's work the images are further dispersed, and their integration is not a&nbsp;value in itself. That&nbsp;is why she shows us a&nbsp;series of unrelated episodes and encounters, in each of which the protagonist rehearses not only a&nbsp;different way of telling a&nbsp;story, in different scenery, but&nbsp;also a&nbsp;different self. He moves swiftly between&nbsp;languages, places, and styles and forms of being; he escapes not only from&nbsp;the past, but&nbsp;also from&nbsp;a&nbsp;future determined by a&nbsp;fixed past. One could therefore ask: who is a&nbsp;man without&nbsp;memory and an awareness of his belonging as a&nbsp;historical figure? Is he –&nbsp;unburdened by fixed narrative –&nbsp;really privileged as a&nbsp;subject of historical knowledge? Is he the chance for&nbsp;a&nbsp;different witnessing and understanding of the relationship between&nbsp;events, for&nbsp;a&nbsp;different hearing, enabling us to shape stories without&nbsp;recourse to the inherited (remembered) and transmitted principles?</p> <p>Fiona Tan allows us to "entertain" various possibilities. Forgetting oneself appears to be emancipatory –&nbsp;after&nbsp;all, the past&nbsp;and memory are burdens and threats.

Europe –&nbsp;as a&nbsp;single body, a&nbsp;formation, a&nbsp;historical entity –&nbsp;is moving towards&nbsp;an uncertain future, with&nbsp;loud protests, images of civil upheaval, economic collapse, and state violence in the background. This&nbsp;is where the political intervention of Fiona Tan's project is most vividly felt. I&nbsp;understand it as an intervention that&nbsp;is not concerned with&nbsp;documenting or commenting on historical or social reality, but&nbsp;which consists of "reorganizing affects to redetermine a&nbsp;perceptual landscape,"<a href="#sdfootnote22sym" name="sdfootnote22anc"><sup>22</sup></a> in which historical problems and forms overlap with&nbsp;the present and come alive within&nbsp;it on new terms.

She filmed in the United States, Japan, and Ireland, recording devastation and destruction, disintegration, the end of social utopias, and the failure of historical fantasies: Detroit –&nbsp;a&nbsp;bankrupt city; Cork –&nbsp;in which the financial crisis of 2008 interrupted numerous housing investments; and Fukushima, in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami. The artist did not create didactic documents, but&nbsp;rather poetic, meditative impressions. In <em>Apocalypse</em>, with&nbsp;the help of the camera she meticulously studies the medieval tapestry <em>L'Apocalypse d'Angers</em> (1373-1383), exhibited in the French Château d'Angers. She examines the details and texture almost obsessively. These images are accompanied by text moving like&nbsp;the "bars" of a&nbsp;news feed, stock market data, election data, or meteorological data.<a href="#sdfootnote23sym" name="sdfootnote23anc"><sup>23</sup></a></p> <p>Fiona Tan does not so much warn us of the coming catastrophe, but&nbsp;makes us aware of what is already happening; she makes us feel it by showing it as estranged but&nbsp;analogous with&nbsp;the familiar. She creates an intricately composed visual anarchive, the dynamics of which are determined by constant multidirectional movement and the affectively charged poetics of loose associations. This&nbsp;meditation on catastrophe is as ambivalent as the total loss of memory: absolute horror is combined here with&nbsp;absolute hope, powerlessness with&nbsp;a&nbsp;sense of creative power. In the face of total disintegration, the future of history finally seems to be open.</p> <p>Similar emotions drive the manifesto written by the French intellectual collective Catastrophe, published on September 22, 2016 by "Libération":</p> <blockquote>We were growing up in an impasse. Surrounded by sentences driven by anxiety which, like&nbsp;drugs, have accumulated in our young minds. As children, we were learning the world and, at the same time, the coming end of the world: every day we listened to the news of the dark siblings Debt and Crisis, whose shadows remained in our heads.

The images were both portraits as well as snapshots of family events, holidays, etc. In galleries the project is presented as a constellation of images on a wall, as well as small books (I saw the London part, in an exhibition in the Photographers' Gallery in 2012). These portraits include many repetitive views and images suggesting they are the ones that bind and define a community: how one looks and how one presents oneself in an image, how one sees oneself, and how one sees others (or who one sees as the other). Individual parts of the project are named after cities/countries, but we almost exclusively see their inhabitants.</p>

<p><a href="#sdfootnote5anc" name="sdfootnote5sym">5</a>In <em>The Shape of Evidence </em>Sophie Berrebi writes about the bringing together of historians and artists in the epoch which, after Annette Wiewiorka, she calls "the era of the witness," i.e. a time when testimony is no longer associated solely with an individual need, but is a social requirement, a service for the community, a kind of imperative, and a duty. Historians reach for other discourses about the past in order to reinvent "writing history" so that the past can still be recorded and interpreted. Berrebi mentions so-called professional historians' practices of intertwining personal themes, self-reflection, changing perspective, and freeing themselves from the corset of academic discourse. As examples of this tendency she mentions <em>Histoire des grands-parents que je n'ai pas eus</em> (2012) by Ivan Jablonka and <em>L'Histoire a part egales</em> (2011) by Roman Bertrand (217), and locates among them the artistic practice of Fiona Tan, whose work counteracts what the critic considers to be the paradox of the digital age, namely "amnesic recording" – the continuous, uninterrupted, forgetful recording and storage of "everything" (218).

<p><a href="#sdfootnote15anc" name="sdfootnote15sym">15</a> An interesting context for thinking about this kind of personality crisis or disorder can be found in French philosopher Catherine Malabou's book <em>The New Wounded: From Neurosis to Brain Damage</em>, trans. Steven Miller (New York: Fordham University Press, 2012). The author analyzes the thin line between disorders that affect the victims of social and political trauma (war, terrorist attacks, domestic violence, etc.) and the victims of brain damage (as a result of diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's). In the light of new research, so-called "organic trauma" and "cultural trauma" do not differ that much, which leads to the conclusion that nature and politics should not be considered in isolation, as has long been the case.</p>
