So could you tell us how you arrived at this&nbsp;idea? And how do you understand the question of dialectics, the dialectical image? Then there is the task of the historian, the link between&nbsp;history and photography—a vision of history as a&nbsp;crime scene, to paraphrase Walter Benjamin—which is very much present in your projects. Another thing which is more biographical and rather delicate: the state of being a&nbsp;German-speaking artist (and thinker) in France is also a&nbsp;question that&nbsp;is worth discussing. Finally, if you could explain how you came up with&nbsp;the idea of superposing text onto&nbsp;image.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5907-1-pb-1920x-951.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5907-1-pb-330x-3d3.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5907-1-pb-660x-d76.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5907-1-pb-768x-36f.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5907-1-pb-1320x-b15.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5907-1-pb-660x-d76.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Arno Gisinger, panoramic view of the exhibition "The Benjamin Constellation", Asymetria Gallery (with Jerzy Lewczyński Archives), Warsaw, 2016.</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p><b>Arno Gisinger</b>: Well, I&nbsp;could start very simply just with&nbsp;a&nbsp;biographical fact: indeed, I&nbsp;went to Paris in 2005 with&nbsp;a&nbsp;very clear plan to live and to work there, because, as you perhaps know, I&nbsp;undertook part of my studies in France. It is important to say that&nbsp;part of my method as an artist derives from&nbsp;my initial studies in Austria at the university and from&nbsp;my theoretical interests. You should know that&nbsp;in my generation, in the 1980s and 1990s, photography had quite an ambiguous status, especially in the German-speaking world. The people who dealt with&nbsp;photography in any theoretical sense at that&nbsp;time came from&nbsp;comparative literature.</p> <p><b>Krzysztof Pijarski</b>: Just like&nbsp;everywhere else, consider Roland Barthes...</p> <p><b>AG</b>: Yes, this&nbsp;is a&nbsp;European phenomenon. Definitely in Austria, Germany and in some English speaking countries too, the researchers interested in photography at this&nbsp;time had a&nbsp;background in literature, narratives, and also history. When I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;young student (and photo amateur) I&nbsp;came in contact with&nbsp;these methodologies and this&nbsp;was very important for&nbsp;me. A&nbsp;this time I&nbsp;was quite naive, just learning new working methods, but&nbsp;now when I&nbsp;think of it, it was very important for&nbsp;my becoming an artist.</p> <p><b>KP</b>: Whom did you read back then? German speaking scholars?</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5909-1-pb-1920x-71e.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5909-1-pb-330x-417.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5909-1-pb-660x-4fa.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5909-1-pb-768x-385.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5909-1-pb-1320x-fd4.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5909-1-pb-660x-4fa.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Arno Gisinger, <em>Europa</em>, from&nbsp;the series <em>Konstellation Benjamin</em>, 2005-2009, color photograph on blue back paper, variable format</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p><b>AG</b>: Yes, there were especially some journals about&nbsp;photography in German speaking countries like&nbsp;<em>Fotogeschichte</em>, <em>Camera Austria,</em> and a&nbsp;little bit later <em>Eikon</em>. I&nbsp;studied German literature and contemporary history in Innsbruck and my interests lay in sources, archives, all that&nbsp;methodology. This&nbsp;was the time when historians were very interested in new kinds of sources like&nbsp;oral history, visual history, etc. So, even in this&nbsp;seemingly unrelated part of my study, I&nbsp;was theoretically in touch with&nbsp;photography.</p> <p>I was an amateur photographer at the time, and when I&nbsp;finished my studies in Innsbruck I&nbsp;really wanted to know more about&nbsp;this medium in a&nbsp;practical sense, and also about&nbsp;photo history, to have a&nbsp;practice other than&nbsp;an amateur one. I&nbsp;found the school in Arles, L’École Nationale Supérieure de la Photographie, where I&nbsp;spent three years, and then I&nbsp;went back to Austria, and finally, I&nbsp;decided to live and work in Paris. I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit frustrated while living in Austria and I&nbsp;decided to put the focus on my artistic practice, and I&nbsp;felt that&nbsp;this was good place to be and that&nbsp;I&nbsp;had some people there who were pushing and encouraging me. So I&nbsp;went there in 2005 and I&nbsp;initiated the Benjamin project. You’re completely right—today, when you look at it in the context of my other work, it’s something that&nbsp;focuses on some essential points from&nbsp;my formation, concerning&nbsp;also a&nbsp;confrontation with&nbsp;the city of Paris. Everybody read Benjamin, everybody was a&nbsp;fan of his writings and this&nbsp;was the time when he became a&nbsp;worldwide phenomenon. It was a&nbsp;little bit naive when I&nbsp;started, but&nbsp;anyhow, I&nbsp;came to live in Paris with&nbsp;the complete works of Benjamin in my library. This&nbsp;aspect also touched my own story, the German speaking artist in Paris, introducing the question of language. I&nbsp;don’t compare my experience with&nbsp;that of Benjamin, but&nbsp;it was a&nbsp;question of how the city was dealing with&nbsp;it at the time, and how somebody who arrived there speaking only German was dealing with&nbsp;the situation. And, as I’d already worked a&nbsp;lot about&nbsp;WWII and the problem of exile, he seemed a&nbsp;perfect figure.</p> <p>Benjamin’s letters published by Suhrkamp Verlag were the crucial point though. They were a&nbsp;real discovery for&nbsp;me, because it is there that&nbsp;I&nbsp;realized that&nbsp;he had this&nbsp;incredible capacity to consider himself as an object and at the same time a&nbsp;subject of history. So on the one hand you can read very pragmatic things there, as when you write letters to your friends—I went there, I&nbsp;did this&nbsp;and I&nbsp;ate this—and he is completely immersed in the life of the period. But&nbsp;at the same time he suddenly becomes the philosopher, the analyst of his times, the historian of the present. In these moments you get very deep and intelligent analyzes of the whole situation, and he says very clearly: I’m part of history. We know this&nbsp;from, amongst others, his <em>Theses on the Philosophy of History</em>, but&nbsp;it is already in his letters where he thinks of himself as both an object and a&nbsp;subject. I&nbsp;discovered very quickly that&nbsp;his Parisian exile was in fact a&nbsp;European exile, and I&nbsp;saw that&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to go to many other places, not only to Paris. Then I&nbsp;got in touch with&nbsp;a&nbsp;researcher, Nathalie Raoux, and at the end of a&nbsp;long work in progress we did the book <em>Konstellation. Walter Benjamin en exil</em> together. Because she is one of the few French philosophers who also works in the archives, who really specialized in Benjamin’s biography. She would know everything; I&nbsp;could ask her what room he lived in at some hotel. She is an incredible source, working with&nbsp;a&nbsp;special status and her own research program at the EHESS, and for&nbsp;20 or 25 years her main research has been Benjamin’s biography in France. She also very clearly made me aware of how to write, or not to write, a&nbsp;Benjamin biography. As you know, Benjamin is this&nbsp;mythical figure, with&nbsp;his heroic suicide in Portbou. When we went to Portbou there were 200 people every day pilgrimaging to pay their respects to Benjamin. So he is an intellectual saint—at the beginning, in the 60s, in the German speaking context, and now worldwide. On the one hand I’m a&nbsp;part of this, but&nbsp;on the other we tried to find a&nbsp;form which would also effect a&nbsp;very Brechtian distancing. We were writing some kind of near-biography but&nbsp;it also was something singular, because we were trying to (re)construct something of the past, a&nbsp;very Benjaminian gesture.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5911-1-pb-1920x-39c.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5911-1-pb-330x-02d.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5911-1-pb-660x-42b.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5911-1-pb-768x-8e5.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5911-1-pb-1320x-775.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5911-1-pb-660x-42b.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Arno Gisinger, <em>Topoï</em>, book with&nbsp;limited print, 2013.</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>As I&nbsp;always do in my works, I&nbsp;start from&nbsp;the present and use historical material, historical figures, or historical text as a&nbsp;mirror of our own time. At the beginning it was something personal, biographically related to Paris, but&nbsp;very quickly the question of exile, the status of an exile emerged, and with&nbsp;it that&nbsp;of topography, language and more generally Europe after&nbsp;2000. This&nbsp;was the first layer. The second layer was Benjamin himself, his thinking, his texts about&nbsp;photography. This&nbsp;was also a&nbsp;major strain for&nbsp;me: how could I&nbsp;approach Benjamin, with&nbsp;so many intelligent people who have written about&nbsp;him, and say anything new or interesting—how to add something to that?</p> <p>I started out with&nbsp;reading once again the <em>Little History of Photography</em>, and I&nbsp;realized very quickly that&nbsp;the books that&nbsp;he had on his table while writing were, on the one hand, on 19<sup>th</sup> century photography, and on the other hand very contemporary ones: the pioneers of photography, and then the latest books of August Sander and Albert Renger-Patzsch. Once again, the contemporary and history are mirroring each other. I&nbsp;responded by looking for&nbsp;a&nbsp;very 19th century photographic style, in this&nbsp;tradition of the tripod, of the shifted photograph with&nbsp;clear vertical elements—a photography which is dealing with&nbsp;the disappearance of the operator based on visibility, a&nbsp;so to say clear access to things with&nbsp;full depth of field. Something that&nbsp;would relate me in my practice to 19<sup>th</sup> century photography, and also to the 1920s and 1930s. A&nbsp;photographic gesture where everything seems to simply be there, and where you have the illusion of access to the thing itself, but&nbsp;anyhow it’s not there; this&nbsp;kind of disappearance. And then I&nbsp;broke this&nbsp;illusion by introducing the text, and also by this&nbsp;idea of the dialectical image, at least my interpretation of it.</p> <p>I was quite aware also of the pilgrimages along&nbsp;Benjamin’s traces, and also of this&nbsp;photographic tradition connected with&nbsp;mass tourism. I&nbsp;was thinking a&nbsp;lot about&nbsp;this: how can I&nbsp;make my project and avoid this&nbsp;Benjamin tourism? Then the letters—I had read them some time before&nbsp;that—came to my mind. I&nbsp;simply took the books with&nbsp;me while traveling, and confronted the text once again with&nbsp;the places where they’d been written. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it was totally disappointing. Sometimes, even if you find this&nbsp;direct relationship, it turns out to be vapid: this&nbsp;is the bedroom where Benjamin slept…</p> <p><b>KP</b>: The <em>wie es gewesen</em> of history…</p> <p><b>AG</b>: The<em> wie es gewesen</em> (Leopold von Ranke) is exactly the point. As you know, Benjamin is completely inverting this. Siegfried Kracauer, another German intellectual who is very important to me, said it is no coincidence that&nbsp;photography—as a&nbsp;medium—was invented at the same time as modern history. And the <em>wie es gewesen</em> is also the gesture of this&nbsp;type of photography…</p> <p><b>KP</b>: And one of the central myths of photography.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5913-1-pb-1920x-48a.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5913-1-pb-330x-ce5.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5913-1-pb-660x-0eb.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5913-1-pb-768x-4b1.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5913-1-pb-1320x-f6e.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5913-1-pb-660x-0eb.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Arno Gisinger, "Topoï", exhibition view Centre Photographique d’Ile de France, Pontault-Combault (France), 2013, on the right side fragment of <em>Konstellation Benjamin</em>, in the middle <em>Messerschmitthalle</em>.</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p><b>AG</b>: Absolutely. My idea was to deconstruct this&nbsp;myth. My intention behind&nbsp;superposing the text onto&nbsp;the image was to disturb it and to create something like&nbsp;a&nbsp;third image, a&nbsp;kind of montage. In the end I&nbsp;arrived at just 36 images, one image per place. When we went to Svendborg (Denmark) for&nbsp;instance, I&nbsp;made about&nbsp;200 pictures and then I&nbsp;chose one, in relation to the other images and the text. My idea was that&nbsp;these two images, or imaginings, were creating a&nbsp;third image—a dialectical one. The third image arises in the eye, or the imagination of the spectator. I&nbsp;was convinced that&nbsp;the text should also be treated as a&nbsp;layer of the image which will be inside&nbsp;and outside&nbsp;of it, in front of it or behind&nbsp;it. It depends on how you were looking at the image or the text before, and it is eventually reading and looking...</p> <p><b>KP</b>: This&nbsp;is something I&nbsp;want to ask you about, because obviously you don’t negotiate the space. You don’t try to place the text so that&nbsp;it works with&nbsp;the specific images, it’s exactly like&nbsp;you said: it’s another layer, it’s superposed. Sometimes it is even in conflict with&nbsp;the image, because you have these moments when it becomes unreadable, forcing you to look very closely. Furthermore, as I&nbsp;noticed, the text is aligned throughout the project, so that&nbsp;when you align the pictures you also align the text, a&nbsp;formal decision that&nbsp;was clearly taken outside&nbsp;of the specificity of the images in the project.</p> <p><b>AG</b>: Exactly, but&nbsp;when I&nbsp;do the montage, I&nbsp;try to figure out how the text will work with&nbsp;the image. It’s not completely <em>aléatoire</em>. And then there is this&nbsp;second aspect which is the materiality of the work. I&nbsp;wanted to go back to this&nbsp;blueback paper I&nbsp;was experimenting with&nbsp;since the late 1990s, which is for&nbsp;me not in the same tradition as, in the French context, Jean-Luc Moulène for&nbsp;instance—to refer to another artist whose work is very important for&nbsp;me—who worked with&nbsp;similar materials but&nbsp;in the context of <em>affiche</em> in the sense of an image in public space. I&nbsp;was working with&nbsp;an Italian enterprise producing ink-jet technologies—Durst. Known for&nbsp;their enlargers, they quickly realized that&nbsp;the new digital technology would replace the analogue, so they were looking for&nbsp;a&nbsp;very precise photographic image but&nbsp;on ink jet print. They were developing machines and at that&nbsp;time I&nbsp;acted as an artistic consultant for&nbsp;them. They were testing the machines on blueback paper, and then they’d throw it away, not a&nbsp;material to keep really. I&nbsp;realized that&nbsp;the quality of the image is very good. The decision was very clear—not to have this&nbsp;stable form of a&nbsp;framed image, but&nbsp;something which allowed me to develop a&nbsp;certain sense of space. Every time the format, and also sometimes decisions about&nbsp;how to cut images, how to install them, are adapted to the given space.</p> <p>Here, in Asymetria, in response to Rafał Lewandowski’s invitation, I&nbsp;proposed the <em>Constellation</em> project, because I&nbsp;wanted to confront it with&nbsp;the archives of Jerzy Lewczyński. The format here is much smaller than&nbsp;usual, because the space is not so big. But&nbsp;I&nbsp;love it too, because it’s more intimate. And coming back to the problem of text: in the bigger format of the print, the relationship between&nbsp;the image and the text is quite different. Here the text seems more important, since&nbsp;the image is less imposing. It is very interesting for&nbsp;me to see how people will look at it.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5915-1-pb-1920x-565.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5915-1-pb-330x-3c8.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5915-1-pb-660x-fe5.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5915-1-pb-768x-908.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5915-1-pb-1320x-fe9.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5915-1-pb-660x-fe5.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Arno Gisinger, "Invent arisiert", 2000, installation view Centre Pompidou, Paris, 2014.

For&nbsp;example, while I&nbsp;was working with&nbsp;an inventory of the looted objects of Viennese Jews (<em>Invent arisiert</em>, 2000),<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a> it was very difficult to decide on typography. Finally, I&nbsp;opted for&nbsp;Helvetica, which is not neutral at all, but&nbsp;it was the best thing for&nbsp;me at the time. These were lambda prints and I&nbsp;put the text in white against&nbsp;a&nbsp;grey background—in fact the floor, on which I&nbsp;put all the objects to photograph them—in very <em>protocol</em> way. So when I&nbsp;was taking the pictures I&nbsp;already knew where I&nbsp;would put the text, and I&nbsp;had this&nbsp;reserved for&nbsp;it in the frame. There the text was replacing or accompanying the object, whereas in the Benjamin project the text interferes with&nbsp;the object of the photograph, disturbing it. It’s also, technically speaking, different, because the lambda print is still a&nbsp;chemical print. <em>Konstellation Benjamin</em> is different again because the white is just the untouched white of the paper, establishing this&nbsp;unstable relationship between&nbsp;foreground and background. Typographic questions are quite delicate, because there is so much cultural tradition and background in typography. I’m very sensitive to graphic design without&nbsp;being a&nbsp;specialist. It is the same with&nbsp;architecture. These two domains are very important for&nbsp;my photographic works: architecture and graphic design.</p> <p><b>KP</b>: And the pictures you’ve just shown us of the looted objects, they strike me as a&nbsp;different exercise. I&nbsp;would say, they look like&nbsp;posters. You could show them as posters in a&nbsp;public space. The structure of the images is such, they have this&nbsp;kind of strong, direct message like&nbsp;a&nbsp;poster should. They would be readable if you had a&nbsp;hundred of them in the city space of Vienna—they would absolutely work in public space.

You can have an institutional reading of these objects, where everything is on the same level, but&nbsp;there is another important aspect which is that&nbsp;of the property of a&nbsp;specific family. I&nbsp;actually put together all the looted objects of eight families, so you can read the project in a&nbsp;very “Boltanski” way: as a&nbsp;portrait of a&nbsp;family and the belongings of that&nbsp;family. You can have this&nbsp;double reading, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;think what is most important are the missing objects. Since&nbsp;I&nbsp;have more missing objects than&nbsp;physically present ones, the wall as a&nbsp;whole was rather grey with&nbsp;some colourful points and spots, but&nbsp;the rest was just absence, which was clearly coming out of the inventory itself. I&nbsp;was really surprised when I&nbsp;put it up for&nbsp;the first time on a&nbsp;wall, that&nbsp;this new image, deriving from&nbsp;my approach to that&nbsp;visual archive, was more of an absence of things than&nbsp;of their accumulation.</p> <p>When I’m talking about&nbsp;archives, it’s more about&nbsp;sources than&nbsp;about archives in the general sense.

We had a&nbsp;huge vitrine-table installed in front of a&nbsp;grey wall with&nbsp;a&nbsp;white reserve. At this&nbsp;table 25 persons worked together for&nbsp;10 days.

I’m clearly part of a&nbsp;generation who brought up questions which were not discussed for&nbsp;nearly 50 years after&nbsp;WWII. In Austria it was definitely the period of the 80s and 90s when young historians, artists, art historians, intellectuals, writers, citizens, everybody was concerned by this&nbsp;question, by this&nbsp;denial in a&nbsp;very Freudian sense, so I’m clearly influenced by this&nbsp;question. And I&nbsp;found in photography a&nbsp;medium which was, for&nbsp;me, able to say something about&nbsp;this. Appearance, reappearance, disappearance, reconstitution, reconstruction, illusion—political work in fact. Going then to looted art was some kind of going into&nbsp;the heart of the question, different from&nbsp;the subject of <em>Invent arisiert</em>, because these were private objects, not very precious in terms of market value, but&nbsp;very precious in a&nbsp;personal sense.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5921-1-pb-1920x-24a.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5921-1-pb-330x-dea.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5921-1-pb-660x-2fb.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5921-1-pb-768x-53c.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5921-1-pb-1320x-b0c.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5921-1-pb-660x-2fb.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>"Les sources au travail.

Why is it such an important tool for&nbsp;you?</p> <p><b>AG</b>: I&nbsp;don’t know, this&nbsp;is perhaps very banal, because everybody says it—this is the medium which is attached to the referent in a&nbsp;certain way... Perhaps not in this&nbsp;mythical, Barthesian sense of the trace, because I&nbsp;think this&nbsp;is more a&nbsp;cultural construction than&nbsp;an ontological condition. In German we would say <em>Ein Rest des Authentischen</em>— [vestiges of the authentic]. It’s not the physical trace of something, but&nbsp;we still feel this&nbsp;attachment to the real. On the other hand there is this&nbsp;incredible capacity to go into&nbsp;fictional zones. And I&nbsp;think that&nbsp;photography, by this&nbsp;culturally constructed attachment to reality, is the best medium for&nbsp;me. In a&nbsp;certain sense I&nbsp;try to follow the idea of Kracauer,<a href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a> to say something about&nbsp;how we construct history and how we can rewrite history in the present time. Photography is just a&nbsp;perfect instrument for&nbsp;me. Is it because ontologically photography has this&nbsp;or that&nbsp;specific aspect? I&nbsp;don’t really know. I’m more and more skeptical about&nbsp;all the ontological questions: “photography is this, so this&nbsp;is the reason why I&nbsp;would use it.” I&nbsp;even think that&nbsp;less and less theoretical approaches now try to find <em>the</em> sense on this&nbsp;ontological level, like&nbsp;Roland Barthes did: “this is specific for&nbsp;photography and this&nbsp;is the difference from&nbsp;other media.”</p> <p><b>KP</b>: There have been some attempts to return to ontology, like&nbsp;James Elkins’ <em>What Photography Is</em>. But&nbsp;maybe the question should be: what can photography do, or what can we do with&nbsp;photography?</p> <p><b>AG</b>: Yes, I&nbsp;agree, because images can be “sources at work,” as we said. This&nbsp;is also once again coming from&nbsp;my initial studies—as I&nbsp;already mentioned I’m very much fascinated by photography as a&nbsp;source. In this&nbsp;context, creating new photographs is on the same level for&nbsp;me as reusing, reinterpreting, or integrating old photographs into&nbsp;my own work. A&nbsp;good example would be my project for&nbsp;Hohenems (<em>Dies ist der Stuhl für den Paten</em>, 2001)<a href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a> in Austria, also on looted objects. There was nothing left in this&nbsp;little village from&nbsp;the Jewish community, just a&nbsp;document in the archives produced by Austrian Nazis, who made a&nbsp;list of all the liturgical objects of the synagogue. Officially everything has disappeared, we don’t know where it is, all that&nbsp;is left is this&nbsp;document. Then there is another source, a&nbsp;photographic source, which is very different to the written one—it was made by a&nbsp;Jewish ethnographer—a photograph of a&nbsp;double stool from&nbsp;Hohenems taken in the 1920s as an example of the liturgical practice of assimilated Jewish communities, perhaps already in the fear that&nbsp;this culture might disappear. This&nbsp;ethnographer (Theodor Harburger) was traveling around&nbsp;in the region and made hundreds of photographs. The only photograph he made in Hohenems was this&nbsp;stool, and it is the only existing photograph of this&nbsp;object.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5923-1-pb-1920x-f02.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5923-1-pb-330x-7d4.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5923-1-pb-660x-0d2.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5923-1-pb-768x-477.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5923-1-pb-1320x-84a.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5923-1-pb-660x-0d2.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Arno Gisinger, "Dies ist der Stuhl für den Paten", 2001, Installation view in the former Synagogue, Hohenems, Austria.</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p><b>KP</b>: Is the object on the list?</p> <p><b>AG</b>: It is on the list, but&nbsp;the only way to see it, to mark its presence, is this&nbsp;photograph. With&nbsp;all the problems of the photograph. This&nbsp;is somebody who says “well, our culture is very interesting, a&nbsp;result of 19<sup>th</sup> century assimilation in the region of the Lake of Constance in Germany, Switzerland and the Western part of Austria, so let’s do a&nbsp;recollection of these things with&nbsp;photography.” I&nbsp;mean, this&nbsp;is a&nbsp;fascinating idea for&nbsp;me, it’s a&nbsp;question of sources. Sometimes perhaps I&nbsp;could say I’m creating new sources, and sometimes I’m just using or reinterpreting existing ones. And photography is a&nbsp;tool to do this, but&nbsp;it’s not a&nbsp;sense in itself.</p> <p><b>KP</b>: What kind of experience are you after&nbsp;when you show your work? What is it that&nbsp;you want to do to the viewer, receiver?</p> <p><b>AG</b>: This&nbsp;is a&nbsp;very important point and it’s related to the status of photography, perhaps another answer for&nbsp;what you asked me about&nbsp;the medium—what really fascinates me is its capacity to have very different statuses. It can be a&nbsp;very banal image, an album photograph, it can be a&nbsp;work of art, or an illustration of something. And this&nbsp;is perhaps the specific point of photography—it can have so many faces, so many uses, so many interpretations. I&nbsp;think, the real point for&nbsp;me is how the photographic image can be used, regarded in an anthropological way. As you know, I’m familiar with&nbsp;Georges Didi-Huberman’s thinking and theory. In that&nbsp;sense I&nbsp;think we found each other—me from&nbsp;a&nbsp;practical point of view and he from&nbsp;a&nbsp;philosophical point of view. But&nbsp;this is indeed the most important point for&nbsp;me. How do we look at photographs? In what cultural and physical context do we look at them? And since&nbsp;I’m working in between&nbsp;history and art, I&nbsp;understand photography as an emanation of the past&nbsp;and as creation in present time. This&nbsp;ambiguity was quite a&nbsp;problem for&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain time in my work, when I&nbsp;wanted to consider myself an artist. Because some people said “this is documentary, this&nbsp;is not art” or “You can only understand the work if you give an explication in a&nbsp;historical sense.” I&nbsp;tried to place my work in-between this, and it was quite uncomfortable for&nbsp;a&nbsp;long time. Now, with&nbsp;experience in these kinds of projects, I’m a&nbsp;little bit more confident perhaps, and I&nbsp;would say: no, this&nbsp;is exactly the interesting point, because these images change with&nbsp;the context of the presentation. We can come back to Benjamin, which I&nbsp;have shown in different places and different forms. This&nbsp;work has completely changed here, in Asymetria, in the context of Warsaw. It’s clearly not the same work and this&nbsp;is incredible. My intention is to confront my work with&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific context, and to have feedback from&nbsp;there.</p> <p><b>TS</b>: What you said is also important for&nbsp;a&nbsp;better understanding of the projects you did with&nbsp;Georges Didi-Huberman (<em>Atlas, suite</em>, <em>Afteratlas</em>, <em>Nouvelles histoires de fantômes</em>).

This&nbsp;is a&nbsp;link coming from&nbsp;this project, because, you have perhaps seen that&nbsp;Georges Didi-Huberman at that&nbsp;time made a&nbsp;little postface in the book about&nbsp;the Benjamin project, published in 2009.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a> A&nbsp;couple of years later he called me for&nbsp;the <em>Atlas </em>project so the idea was coming from&nbsp;him. He said: “I have this&nbsp;huge exhibition at the Reina Sofia. People want me to continue the project, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t want to continue and I&nbsp;can’t continue it, because it’s too expensive… But&nbsp;could we make a&nbsp;project together in a&nbsp;very Benjaminian sense—a photographic interpretation of an exhibition? I&nbsp;thought of your Benjamin work with&nbsp;your method of gluing the paper to the wall, of adapting the work to the site, and not transporting another work of art—this could be a&nbsp;good idea.”</p> <p>So it’s very logical that&nbsp;<em>Atlas, suite</em> and the work with&nbsp;Georges Didi-Huberman was coming from&nbsp;the Benjaminian focus and going further into&nbsp;the question of what photography does to, or with, a&nbsp;work of art. It’s an economic question, a&nbsp;question of the status of art. I&nbsp;thought that&nbsp;this was a&nbsp;very difficult thing to do and I&nbsp;was searching for&nbsp;my own approach to this. And the answer came from&nbsp;Warburg. As you know Warburg was one the first art historians to use photography systematically. Then he invented this&nbsp;<em>dispositif</em> device for&nbsp;his <em>Atlas Mnemosyne</em>, going back to the tradition of the atlas from&nbsp;the 18th, and 19th centuries. Some photographs he ordered from&nbsp;well-known photographers like&nbsp;the Alinari Brothers, sometimes he just cut them out from&nbsp;the newspaper. This&nbsp;collaboration with&nbsp;Georges Didi-Huberman was about—to say it after&nbsp;Warburg—the <em>Nachleben</em> of his own invention. In fact, we perceive the <em>Atlas Mnemosyne</em> photographically, because the second step was as important as the first one—he asked his assistant to make a&nbsp;photograph of each constellation, which is something contradictory to his open process.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5926-1-pb-1920x-09b.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5926-1-pb-330x-9bb.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5926-1-pb-660x-b1c.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5926-1-pb-768x-48c.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5926-1-pb-1320x-01c.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5926-1-pb-660x-b1c.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Georges Didi-Huberman / Arno Gisinger, "Nouvelles histoires de fantômes".

Have you noticed that&nbsp;nobody has attempted to reconstruct the <em>Atlas</em> in color? It’s always reproduced in black and white, whereas the materials Warburg used were varied, with&nbsp;different colors of paper, different senses of materiality, and the act of re-photographing them totally flattens out this&nbsp;kind of texture. That’s also something that&nbsp;Georges Didi-Huberman talked about&nbsp;in this&nbsp;exhibition—that is why is it horizontal, at least to me. It is thought of as a&nbsp;working surface. If you make something vertical, it’s kind of final, it’s done. In French, Didi-Huberman makes a&nbsp;distinction between&nbsp;<em>table</em> and <em>tableau</em>…</p> <p><b>AG</b>: It’s very interesting what you’re saying. The black and white is an aspect of this&nbsp;general thing I’ve tried to say. The photographic is clearly mediating our perception of the Warburgian work. And you can see it in the publications of the last few years. It’s fixing something. And it’s even contradictory to Warburg’s ideas. This&nbsp;is exactly the paradox of photography—while we have a&nbsp;knowledge about&nbsp;his methods thanks to photography, it is photography that&nbsp;produces this&nbsp;still image, freezing for&nbsp;once and for&nbsp;all what was a&nbsp;dynamic way of working with&nbsp;images.</p> <p><b>KP</b>: This&nbsp;is the fetishistic aspect of photography. It makes fetishes that&nbsp;we are unable to touch. Further generations of scholars interpret the reproductions; they do not interpret the gestures, they interpret the image.</p> <p><b>AG</b>: Are you familiar, in that&nbsp;context, with&nbsp;the actual discussions about&nbsp;the question of exhibition photographs? There is a&nbsp;large discussion going on in Paris, in France, among&nbsp;specialists, but&nbsp;there are also research projects at institutions like&nbsp;the Centre Pompidou or Bétonsalon. The first research was done ten years ago by Rémi Parcollet who has written a&nbsp;doctoral thesis about&nbsp;the genre of exhibition photographs. Bétonsalon did an exhibition quoting Susan Sontag: “We only remember the photographs” (<em><a href="http://www.betonsalon.net/spip.php?article465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On ne se souvient que des photographies</a></em>).<a href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a> This&nbsp;is exactly the topic. With&nbsp;Warburg we only remember the photographs, with&nbsp;exhibitions it is the same thing. Our memory is definitely photographic. We will only remember the photographs of works of art. Warburg didn’t really formulate it in a&nbsp;theoretical way, but&nbsp;intuitively he was very aware of it. We were discussing many times with&nbsp;Georges Didi-Huberman this&nbsp;relationship between&nbsp;the artist and the photograph, and the role photography plays in the perception of art history. Coming from&nbsp;Wölfflin, going to Warburg and to Malraux, up to the very contemporary questions of how photographic images transform our perception of exhibitions and works of art. Rémi Parcollet says something very interesting: he talks about&nbsp;the <em>patrimonialisation</em> (heritagisation) of exhibitions via&nbsp;photography. Photography is freezing it. I&nbsp;think we should really think about&nbsp;this aspect. And it’s a&nbsp;fetish, you are completely right. I&nbsp;think this&nbsp;will be a&nbsp;very important thing in the future, because in our way of dealing with&nbsp;images now there is a&nbsp;tension between&nbsp;the fetishization and the flux of images, so it is perhaps no coincidence that&nbsp;we rediscover Warburg, because there is a&nbsp;fear of this&nbsp;flux.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5928-1-pb-1920x-e1a.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5928-1-pb-330x-b87.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5928-1-pb-660x-534.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5928-1-pb-768x-7d7.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5928-1-pb-1320x-b9e.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5928-1-pb-660x-534.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Georges Didi-Huberman / Arno Gisinger, "Afteratlas".

To share is more and more difficult, because there are more and more regulations that&nbsp;prohibit it. Have you ever had this&nbsp;kind of problem with&nbsp;your work? Did anybody lay claim to your pictures?</p> <p><b>AG</b>: I&nbsp;never had real problems but&nbsp;maybe the <em>Atlas</em> project will make an interesting case study. The point is that&nbsp;we don’t have explicit permission from&nbsp;all the artists appearing there. This&nbsp;is perhaps the weakest and the most interesting point of the project. Until&nbsp;now we have had no problems whatsoever and we always said that&nbsp;if somebody doesn’t want to be shown like&nbsp;this, we can exclude the given image from&nbsp;the project, but&nbsp;we didn’t contact all the artists or all the institutions. We had permission to photograph in the space, so for&nbsp;us this&nbsp;was a&nbsp;way to do it, like&nbsp;a&nbsp;photographer who is allowed to photograph an exhibition. But&nbsp;now the big question is the status of this&nbsp;work. As you know, we did four exhibitions, and I&nbsp;always claim that&nbsp;there is no original, no new work of art, it’s more like&nbsp;theater interpretation, <em>répertoire</em>, for&nbsp;a&nbsp;limited period. But&nbsp;now, as we have finished the project, the question is what to do with&nbsp;this, what status does it have. This&nbsp;is an important question that&nbsp;we have at the moment with&nbsp;Georges, because there is one institution which would be interested to have it, but&nbsp;the first question was rights, of course. Now, coming back to your question, I&nbsp;am obliged to clarify all the rights with&nbsp;all the people concerned. On the other hand—I am not trying to sell it, to capitalize it in the sense of money so I&nbsp;told them that&nbsp;my interest is just to conserve it, so I’d prefer to give them my archives, with&nbsp;the documentation of all four projects. The answer was “Well, this&nbsp;very difficult, because <em>acquisition</em> doesn’t concern archives. You can offer us your archives but&nbsp;acquisition concerns only a&nbsp;work of art,” and we are back at the problem of rights. So I’m not even able to offer my archives on the... it’s quite complicated. The rights need to be cleared for&nbsp;the institution to be able to buy a&nbsp;work, and then I&nbsp;can give them, as an apparatus, my archive to accompany it. And it will have the status of an apparatus to gain an insight into&nbsp;the working methods of the artist, but&nbsp;it doesn’t have the status of a&nbsp;work of art. It’s complimentary to the acquisition of a&nbsp;work of art.</p> <p><b>TS</b>: Let’s talk about&nbsp;this notion of “in-between” in the context of your projects. Your attitude, your position, is problematic in some sense. You take a&nbsp;position between&nbsp;being a&nbsp;historian and being a&nbsp;photographer, but&nbsp;also being a&nbsp;curator. I&nbsp;want also to mention here that&nbsp;you are <em>maître de conference</em> at the university Paris VIII. I&nbsp;would come back to <em>Atlas</em> because your position is also very interesting there: you are not a&nbsp;curator, in fact you are not part of the main exhibition as an artist, you’ re somebody who is...</p> <p><b>AG</b>: Coming afterwards?</p> <p><b>TS</b>: Yes, exactly.

Some of them didn’t have any problem with&nbsp;this kind of undefined situation, for&nbsp;others it was a&nbsp;problem. Regarding&nbsp;Georges’ and my own involvement—what was our role exactly? That&nbsp;of a&nbsp;curator? That&nbsp;of a&nbsp;photographer, of an artist? To be sure, these questions came from&nbsp;outside, because when we started the project, we didn’t know where we were going with&nbsp;it exactly, it was all very intuitive, and not very elaborated theoretically. It was more a&nbsp;question of doing, and the concepts and the theoretical problems came out of doing it. So it’s a&nbsp;question of a&nbsp;collaboration of an art historian and a&nbsp;photographer, creating something which is difficult to define. We were at the same time the curators and the inventors of a&nbsp;specific form. In the Palais de Tokyo it was quite interesting: the invitation had come from&nbsp;the director Jean de Loisy, but&nbsp;then very quickly we had a&nbsp;curator who was working with&nbsp;us, and a&nbsp;technical team. The curator was quite uncomfortable, because there was Georges Didi-Huberman coming with&nbsp;this project, and he was very much admiring Georges and his work. And there was this&nbsp;photographer, but&nbsp;what was he was really doing? So he very quickly said: “No, I’m not the curator here, I&nbsp;just accompany the project.” He distanced himself from&nbsp;his curatorial role, and we started to set up the show together, in collaboration with&nbsp;the technical team. Conceptually it was a&nbsp;response to the given exhibition space, and it came from&nbsp;other experiences, like&nbsp;my work about&nbsp;panoramas and what I&nbsp;called the <em>faux terrain</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a> In Le Fresnoy, where we had a&nbsp;large space with&nbsp;a&nbsp;circle of a&nbsp;balconies which was going around, the photographic images were in the back of the balconies, and the projections were in the middle. Then when we saw the Palais de Tokyo and this&nbsp;beautiful curve, and we decided to adapt this&nbsp;to another sense of space, to have only one balcony allowing one to walk into&nbsp;the projected images on the ground floor, which was not possible in Le Fresnoy but&nbsp;which was allowed, or even encouraged at the Palais de Tokyo. You know, <em>faux terrain</em> is the zone of a&nbsp;panorama you are not allowed to enter. The idea is to keep you away from&nbsp;the image. And what I&nbsp;was doing at the Palais de Tokyo was going into&nbsp;the forbidden zone, the threshold of the illusion. Is it two- or three-dimensional? Is this&nbsp;a&nbsp;real shoe? When we saw the space we said—well, let’s try to establish a&nbsp;first zone which is based on illusion, so we built a&nbsp;wall and people had to go up a&nbsp;staircase and discover the exhibition like&nbsp;a&nbsp;panorama, where you have to go through&nbsp;a&nbsp;tunnel only to arrive in the middle of the illusion, like&nbsp;in Wrocław, at the Racławice Panorama. So at the Palais de Tokyo the first view of the show was immersive, and encompassing. Then we wanted the viewer to descend to the mezzanine, this&nbsp;in-between, where you had another light, this&nbsp;neon light where you could see “oh, this&nbsp;is only paper, not a&nbsp;projection,” and then you’d descend further, and walk amongst and into&nbsp;the images, which were projected from&nbsp;above, into&nbsp;the <em>faux terrain</em>. Some people were feeling drunk, others were afraid. All in all we had very interesting responses to this&nbsp;structure of experience, where we first set up an illusion, and then deconstructed it, step by step.</p> <p><b>TS</b>: Very briefly: what happened with&nbsp;that project in Beirut and in Rio de Janeiro?</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5932-1-pb-1920x-02f.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5932-1-pb-330x-520.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5932-1-pb-660x-82c.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5932-1-pb-768x-fa0.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5932-1-pb-1320x-fb3.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/14/constellations/415-5932-1-pb-660x-82c.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Georges Didi-Huberman / Arno Gisinger, "Atlas, suite", Museu de Arte do Rio, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2013.

There are two buildings, one is older, from&nbsp;the 19th century, which is the building for&nbsp;art exhibitions. The other building is more recent—it was built in the 1950s and is dedicated mostly to education, with&nbsp;a&nbsp;future library… At first we were supposed to install on the fourth floor of the art building, but&nbsp;then it turned out that&nbsp;there was not enough space, we were offered the other building, more specifically the site for&nbsp;the future library. We agreed, although technically speaking we didn’t have the possibility to have a&nbsp;closed room, because there is a&nbsp;glass facade with&nbsp;beautiful lights, making work with&nbsp;projections difficult. Because the space was still rather small, we mostly showed the photographic part of <em>Atlas, suite</em>, with&nbsp;just a&nbsp;small projection. I&nbsp;printed the pictures on wooden plates and we laid them out on the floor. We arranged these islands on the floor, and it produced the same effect—the viewers had to look at the image from&nbsp;above. And in Beirut it was once again different, because it was at Beirut Art Center—an industrial building in the industrial zone of a&nbsp;politically and historically charged city. Now they try to diminish this&nbsp;aspect a&nbsp;little bit, but... At the time there were these huge advertising billboards everywhere. So my idea was to develop a&nbsp;bigger format, to put these “wallpapers” into&nbsp;the exhibition space. Technically it was also very important for&nbsp;me, because we had two openings, in Beirut in January, and the second in Palais de Tokyo in February, so for&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain time we had both instances of the project at the same time. I&nbsp;wanted to have the same format but&nbsp;another selection of images, to see how the same format would work in the different sites. At the Palais de Tokyo, with&nbsp;its 8 meters of height, I&nbsp;simply needed to have bigger images, and I&nbsp;could test this&nbsp;size in Beirut. The size I&nbsp;chose—240 x 312 centimeters—was quite big for&nbsp;the Beirut Art Center, because the height of the wall is 3 meters there, and relatively small at the Palais de Tokyo.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div>
