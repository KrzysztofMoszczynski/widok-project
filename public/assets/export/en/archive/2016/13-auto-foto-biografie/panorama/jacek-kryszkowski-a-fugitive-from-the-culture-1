Witkacy’s) grave in 1985 was published by Jacek Kryszkowski in his magazine, <em>Hola Hoop,</em> that&nbsp;same year. Kryszkowski, accompanied by his wife Elżbieta Kacprzak and a&nbsp;friend, Mikołaj “Miken” Malinowski (and Malinowski’s wife is also mentioned between&nbsp;the lines), supposedly reached Witkacy’s grave in Jeziory, Ukraine, dug up a&nbsp;bone, then ground it up and brought it back to Poland. 1985 was the hundredth anniversary of Witkacy’s birth: UNESCO declared it the year of Witkacy, a&nbsp;national initiative was planned to bring Witkacy’s ashes back to Poland, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commenced a&nbsp;dialogue with&nbsp;the authorities of the Soviet Union. This&nbsp;was the background for&nbsp;Kryszkowski’s trip (“I wish, on behalf of the participants in the expedition, to apologize to Mr Dolatkowski’s Witkacy Committee for&nbsp;the fact that&nbsp;their efforts to bring back the corpse no longer make any sense. I&nbsp;propose suspending the activity.”<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a>). He attached small plastic bags containing some ashes to each of the approximately one hundred copies of his magazine and then sent them to friends and Witkacy scholars. In Kryszkowski’s archive there is a&nbsp;letter dated 17th March 1987 in which photos of the village of Jeziory are requested by Włodzimierz Ziemlański (“I have a&nbsp;photo of Witkacy’s grave”) –&nbsp;a&nbsp;witness to Witkacy’s burial who had marked the nameless grave which enabled a&nbsp;tombstone to be erected. Kryszkowski’s account is supplemented with&nbsp;three photographs from&nbsp;the cemetery showing the group posing next to Witkacy’s grave and guarded by “a local female member of the Pioneer [Girl Scout] movement on duty at the cemetery” as well as Kryszkowski digging up the grave with&nbsp;a&nbsp;spade and also, in another photo, looking at an unearthed bone held in his hand. On the cover of the magazine there is a&nbsp;photo of the grave. Inside&nbsp;there is a&nbsp;handmade map of the area around&nbsp;Jeziory.</p> <p>In 1994 the account was reprinted in <em>Magazyn Sztuki</em> [Art Magazine] (Issue No. 2-3). It was then that&nbsp;the expedition became the subject of interest to researchers and artists. Waldemar Żyszkiewicz in <em>Dwie ekshumacje i&nbsp;pogrzeb</em> [Two Exhumations and a&nbsp;Funeral] (1999) writes about&nbsp;“appalling” pictures, “shocking” descriptions of events and “graphic details”.<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a> Jerzy Truszkowski, in a&nbsp;book called <em>Artyści radykalni</em> [Radical Artists] (2004), calls Kryszkowski’s expedition “the most daring artistic act in Polish art”.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a> Likewise, Ewa Domańska in her article <em>Transhumanacja, czyli przepędzanie zwłok Witkacego </em>[Transhumanations or the Driving of Witkacy’s Corpse]<em> </em>(2010) writes about&nbsp;“Jacek Kryszkowski’s radical action”.<a href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a> The event finds its place in the art market as an element of exhibitions (e.g. <em>Poszliśmy do Croatan</em> [We went to Croatan] at the Modern Art Centre in Torun, 2009) and art history (<em>Przewodnik po sztuce </em>[A Guide to Art]<em> </em>by Zbigniew Libera, endorsed by the Muzeum Sztuki [Museum of Art] in Lodz and the National Audiovisual Institute). The expedition becomes an artistic, historical and scholarly fact, and the account and documentation presented by Kryszkowski serve as a&nbsp;source for&nbsp;its reconstruction. This&nbsp;is despite&nbsp;the doubts voiced with&nbsp;regard to the authenticity of the ashes repatriated by him. “How many and what sort of bones did Kryszkowski excavate?”, asked Domańska and remarked, “Even though Kryszkowski dug within&nbsp;the surround of the grave marked as Witkacy’s, it is known from&nbsp;other sources that&nbsp;the old cemetery in Jeziory was neglected and some excavations had been carried out there in connection with&nbsp;roadworks and various remains were relocated without&nbsp;any markings. Therefore, Kryszkowski could have come across&nbsp;some other person’s remains”.<a href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a></p> <p>I carried out my investigation guided by the words of Elżbieta Kacprzak under&nbsp;the account of the expedition: “I would like&nbsp;to say here that&nbsp;there are a&nbsp;lot of fake bags with&nbsp;the remains going around. Various people very often deceive…, often those considered to be good friends… deceive others, are double-faced, and this&nbsp;is the so-called double morality”.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a> The investigation determines the structure of the text. It contains a&nbsp;portrait of Jacek Kryszkowski as an artist, created based on photographs, recordings and hundreds of pages of his writings, both published and those from&nbsp;his private archives. This&nbsp;is the first ever attempt at a&nbsp;comprehensive description of his output. An output which, apart from&nbsp;his student years, is inextricably linked with&nbsp;the artistic movement called Kultura Zrzuty (Pitch-in Culture) in Lodz, and is completely confined to the 1980s. In 1990 Kryszkowski finally retired from&nbsp;the world of art. He died in 2006.</p> <p>I want to show here the complex potential of the “abandonment of culture” as designed and practised by Kryszkowski. This&nbsp;will, in turn, allow me to throw new light on the central event in his output, i.e. <em>The trip to Russia to fetch Witkacy</em>. The event which, to paraphrase Truszkowski, with&nbsp;a&nbsp;correction in the spirit of Kryszkowski, I&nbsp;will already now allow myself to call the most perverse act in Polish art.</p> <h2><b>Bryszek’s most detested word –&nbsp;“art”</b></h2> <p>The year 1985 might be one of the end dates for&nbsp;the existence of the Lodz-based Kultura Zrzuty, and certainly for&nbsp;its heroic period. The circle was formed in late 1981 (the initiating event is considered to be <em>Spotkanie Młodych</em> [The Meeting of the Young] at the S Gallery in Torun, co-organized by Kryszkowski) and was centred around&nbsp;the “institutions” that&nbsp;it established, such as Strych [Attic], Tango and en plein air sessions in Teofilow, falling squarely within&nbsp;the so-called “third circulation” of art in the 1980s (functioning outside&nbsp;the official state-controlled market or that&nbsp;supported by the Church). In November 1985, in Zielona Góra, the First New Art Biennale took place attended by a&nbsp;lot of people associated with&nbsp;the former underground including some from&nbsp;Kultura Zrzuty. Jacek Jóźwiak (who coined the term “Kultura Zrzuty”) put on a&nbsp;performance during&nbsp;which he symbolically burnt Tango’s<em> </em>collection. The biennale was the first of the large collective events that&nbsp;took place in the latter part of the decade marking the emergence of the former underground; this&nbsp;process on the one hand was linked to exhaustion caused by martial law, and on the other hand, resulted from&nbsp;further corrosion of the system. The art market was emerging tentatively, and the person who ruled the roost was Andrzej Bonarski, an art dealer and organizer of numerous exhibitions (including the far-famed <em>Co słychać? </em>[How Are Things?]<em> </em>from 1987). Some perceived a&nbsp;chance here, others a&nbsp;threat. The latter included Kryszkowski.</p> <p>In 1985 Józef Robakowski published his first essay on Kultura Zrzuty, <em>Pitch-in Culture</em>, in the Munich-based magazine <em>Neue Kunst in Europa</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a> He applied this&nbsp;name to the entirity of independent artistic life of the 1980s in Poland, perceiving in it an extension of art and independent institutions of the previous decade, including his own activity. The essay raised objections within&nbsp;the sphere itself, the strongest being from&nbsp;Kryszkowski.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a> He protested against&nbsp;Kultura Zrzuty being added to the tradition of the neo-avant-garde by a&nbsp;“visiting participant”, “professor Józef Robakowski”; not because he wanted to defend its originality but&nbsp;because he wanted to believe in the impossibility of including it in any categories available to culture or art. As he wrote, Kultura Zrzuty was made up of a&nbsp;number of phenomena that&nbsp;“were with&nbsp;wide-ranging conventionality and contrariness called … the culture of ‘Zrzuta’ (after all have nothing to do with&nbsp;culture)”.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a> Robakowski’s gesture of attempting to place the movement within&nbsp;the history of art was for&nbsp;him usurpation and the beginning of the end.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5277-1-pb-1920x-645.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5277-1-pb-330x-bfd.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5277-1-pb-660x-677.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5277-1-pb-768x-fff.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5277-1-pb-1320x-a39.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5277-1-pb-660x-677.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Jacek Kryszkowski's MA thesis, 1980.<br>Photo from&nbsp;J.K.'s archive</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>Beginning in 1985, Kryszkowski was increasingly opposed to those in Kultura Zrzuty. He established a&nbsp;magazine of his own. He played games and spread subversion. If the group Łódź Kaliska (with Marek Janiak and Adam Rzepecki at the forefront) were to be considered the most important and most influential body within&nbsp;the spheres of Kultura Zrzuty, then Jacek Kryszkowski was its strongest critical pole. Kryszkowski did not participate in creating the book that&nbsp;summed up the output of Kultura Zrzuty. It was published in 1989 and remains the only book of its kind. In the introduction, the editor of the book, Marek Janiak, writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>Finally, I&nbsp;will explain why Jacek Bryszkowski, who is an important figure for&nbsp;Kultura Zrzuty, is only represented here rather modestly (albeit tastefully). Well, Jacek emphatically, unequivocally and, on top of that, publicly requested that&nbsp;his legacy not be included in this&nbsp;publication, I&nbsp;am sorry. The reason was that&nbsp;the word “art”, detested by Bryszek, occurs too frequently in it.<a href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a></p> </blockquote> <h2><b>Art pollutes the environment</b></h2> <p>Kryszkowski’s aversion to art is significant bearing in mind that&nbsp;he was one of the very few professionals in the environment of Kultura Zrzuty: in 1980 he graduated from&nbsp;the Faculty of Painting at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts, at the studio of Stefan Gierowski. In a&nbsp;private archive there is a&nbsp;letter dated 30th May 1979, signed by Władysław Loranc, Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Culture and Art: “To Jacek Kryszkowski, the best student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in the academic year 1978/79, wishing you continued success in academic and social work”. However, Kryszkowski had already by that&nbsp;time assumed the position of an opponent.</p> <p>And so, on 18th March 1978, he organized an exhibition titled <em>Muzeum Kiczu</em> [Museum of Kitsch] at the Academy of Fine Arts building. A&nbsp;leaflet signed by Kryszkowski and Anna Kosecka reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>Kitsch is joy and happiness. So many people have succumbed to its effect. Art can only be envious of this&nbsp;attendance even though it boasts that&nbsp;it desires to enrich us inwardly. That&nbsp;is a&nbsp;lofty goal but&nbsp;allow yourselves to indulge in some fun, do not hide your simple needs, allow this&nbsp;tempestuous and maniacal part of your nature to let off&nbsp;steam.<a href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a></p> </blockquote> <p>The institutional criticism hidden in these words became the driving force for&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of performances by Kryszkowski in the late 1970s and early 1980s. A&nbsp;good example is a&nbsp;performance called <em>Zaproszenie do rozmowy</em> [An Invitation to a&nbsp;Conversation] at the Galeria Krytyków [Critics’ Gallery] in the first half of 1981. In the catalogue of the performance Kryszkowski answers a&nbsp;question raised in the introduction and states, “There occurs anticipation of such behaviors of mine that&nbsp;would make me accomplished as an artist”.<a href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a> However, he had no intention of meeting those expectations. Monika Sykulska wrote in <em>Literatura</em>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The management [of Galeria Krytyków] would certainly consent to any exhibits, not necessarily traditional ones; however, empty walls and a&nbsp;catalogue stating that&nbsp;the artist was waiting, during&nbsp;the opening hours of the gallery, for&nbsp;all visitors in the nearby Galeria Repassage, no, this&nbsp;assumption did not fit within&nbsp;any practicable canons. In these circumstances, the “exhibition” was closed down.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a></p> </blockquote>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5280-1-pb-1920x-752.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5280-1-pb-330x-e87.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5280-1-pb-660x-b42.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5280-1-pb-768x-8af.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5280-1-pb-1320x-aac.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5280-1-pb-660x-b42.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p><em>Generał </em>[<em>General</em>], 1981</p> <p>(documentation of action in a&nbsp;form of “book” –&nbsp;left side, ca. 1982).</p> <p>Photo from&nbsp;J.K.'s archive</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>The institutional criticism was intended to serve the purpose of finding a&nbsp;space where a&nbsp;meeting could take place outside&nbsp;the prevailing false patterns of behaviors. During&nbsp;a&nbsp;performance in March 1980, at the Stodoła gallery, by Kryszkowski and a&nbsp;friend of his, Janusz Banach, who died tragically in 1982, Banach allegedly said, “You came here to see something interesting, and I&nbsp;am supposed to satisfy this&nbsp;need of yours… I&nbsp;am not going to tell you anything of interest. But&nbsp;I&nbsp;think that&nbsp;you, each one of you can suggest something interesting to us and try to solve the situation that&nbsp;has arisen. The floor is yours…”.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a> During&nbsp;a&nbsp;meeting designed in such a&nbsp;way there is a&nbsp;change of rules prevailing in the traditional gallery-style reception; it is more about&nbsp;participation than&nbsp;about contemplation; it is not about&nbsp;producing works of art but&nbsp;about art as an event in which the recipient turns from&nbsp;a&nbsp;consumer into&nbsp;a&nbsp;participant.</p> <p>It is from&nbsp;that period that&nbsp;Kryszkowski’s most journalistic actions come. “Some excerpts from&nbsp;his degree work from&nbsp;1980 (combinations with&nbsp;the Moscow Olympics logo) were censored by the academy authorities”,<a href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a> wrote Wojciech Włodarczyk in 1984. As he explained years later,<a href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a> the breaches in the Olympic rings were read as an allusion to the boycott of the Moscow Olympics by some countries in the West. Towards&nbsp;the end of 1981 Kryszkowski appeared in military attire in a&nbsp;series of events entitled <em>Generał</em> [The General] (inter alia, in the film <em>Generał </em>by Janusz Bałdyga and in the art exhibition <em>Konstrukcja w&nbsp;procesie</em> [Construction in Process] in Lodz). In the “book” with&nbsp;photographs from&nbsp;that series he would write, “I was a&nbsp;general until&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;fucking follower to be found in the country”.<a href="#sdfootnote17sym" name="sdfootnote17anc"><sup>17</sup></a> A&nbsp;bit earlier, Kryszkowski performed the happening <em>Robie se flagę </em>[I Make Myself a&nbsp;Flag] in which he knitted a&nbsp;red-and-whiteflag in various locations around&nbsp;Warsaw, for&nbsp;example at the Copernicus Monument, in a&nbsp;street, in a&nbsp;snack bar, on a&nbsp;bus, at a&nbsp;noticeboard with&nbsp;Solidarity announcements, or at a&nbsp;gallery. The reading of these statements is facilitated by the signboard under&nbsp;which Kryszkowski placed them: “Personal point of observation and shaping creative fauna”. The idea here was to conquer the tension between&nbsp;the private and the public, the individual and the collective; and to take sides with&nbsp;privacy (his other motto was “Only where I&nbsp;am”<a href="#sdfootnote18sym" name="sdfootnote18anc"><sup>18</sup></a>). “It was a&nbsp;situation (the Solidarity period) when we were prepared to keep a&nbsp;distance from&nbsp;the situation in culture, art and also those events. … We didn’t have much trust in Solidarity or the authorities”,<a href="#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc"><sup>19</sup></a> said Kryszkowski in 1985. It is significant that&nbsp;in the cycle <em>Generał</em> he dressed up some of his friends, among&nbsp;them Ewa Partum and Jerzy Świdziński, in military attire. And the performance with&nbsp;the Olympic symbols featured photographs of his closest artist friends, Janusz Banach, Janusz Bałdyga, Jerzy Onuch and Łukasz Szajna, placed close to those symbols. When incorporating the photographic documentation of the flag happening into&nbsp;the “book”, Kryszkowski wrote, “The combination of white and red never seems final. I&nbsp;decided to commence a&nbsp;new construction of it. To this&nbsp;documentation I&nbsp;attach a&nbsp;sketch that&nbsp;may be useful in order to carry out similar work”.<a href="#sdfootnote20sym" name="sdfootnote20anc"><sup>20</sup></a></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5282-1-pb-1920x-752.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5282-1-pb-330x-e87.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5282-1-pb-660x-b42.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5282-1-pb-768x-8af.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5282-1-pb-1320x-aac.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5282-1-pb-660x-b42.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p><em>Generał </em>[<em>General</em>], 1981</p> <p>(documentation of action in a&nbsp;form of “book” –&nbsp;right side, ca. 1982).</p> <p>Photo from&nbsp;J.K.'s archive</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>“[Kryszkowski’s] programme boiled down&nbsp;to such statements: more important than&nbsp;art are meetings; we should do whatever is possible and depends on us; we should turn to the common man and not to the public”,<a href="#sdfootnote21sym" name="sdfootnote21anc"><sup>21</sup></a> wrote Włodarczyk in 1984. At the very beginning of his artistic career, Kryszkowski appears to be a&nbsp;follower of the performative movement in art, an heir to performance art on the one hand and, on the other, to conceptual art, well-versed in the latest trends in the art market. He was actively involved in the activities of Warsaw’s avant-garde galleries (Dziekanka, Stodoła, Repassage) as a&nbsp;critical participant.

This&nbsp;was the first of a&nbsp;series of his games with&nbsp;death. The finale was <em>Pałowanie ‘82</em> [Truncheoning ‘82] performed on 16th June 1982 at the private gallery Czyszczenie Dywanów [Carpet Cleaning] in Lodz, run by Adam Paczkowski and Radosław Sowiak. In an extract preserved in the film <em>Państwo wojny </em>[The War State]<em> </em>(a collective work edited by Józef Robakowski, 1982), you can see a&nbsp;half-naked Kryszkowski circling a&nbsp;coffin with&nbsp;an axe. According to a&nbsp;note from&nbsp;that time, published in 1984 by the Gallery, Kryszkowski, together with&nbsp;the participants in the happening, went into&nbsp;town with&nbsp;the said truncheons and reached the Lodz-Środmieście police station undisturbed and turned back there. The point is that&nbsp;the note, signed by Małgorzata Paczkowska, is styled after&nbsp;a&nbsp;schoolgirl’s clumsy disclosures and ends with&nbsp;the statement: “To be honest, Jacek Kryszkowski’s performance did not bring anything new into&nbsp;my life… Unless, perhaps, my subsequent marriage to Adam Paczkowski, the rogue of avant-garde art, might be considered as a&nbsp;change of any sort”.<a href="#sdfootnote25sym" name="sdfootnote25anc"><sup>25</sup></a> The mocking nature of this&nbsp;note, which must have been prepared by Kryszkowski, reflects the direction in which he was heading as a&nbsp;participant in Kultura Zrzuty. From&nbsp;this perspective, the performance around&nbsp;the coffin can be read as a&nbsp;ritual of transition: the Kryszkowski who until&nbsp;13th December 1981 “indiscriminately dealt in art” dies; born is the Kryszkowski who, as “a hooligan in art”, announces without&nbsp;further ado that&nbsp;he has appeared at the “carpeters’” for&nbsp;money and now that&nbsp;it is over, he is selling them that&nbsp;tiny coffin.<a href="#sdfootnote26sym" name="sdfootnote26anc"><sup>26</sup></a></p> <h2><b>A hooligan in art</b></h2> <p>“Artists shock with&nbsp;whatever they can… They sweep with&nbsp;brooms, draw with&nbsp;water on windowpanes, drive nails into&nbsp;things, yell, recite jokes, hang numerous bits of crap on walls, disguise themselves and provoke” while “the audience bravely pretends to enjoy it”. A&nbsp;report from&nbsp;an event called <em>Nurt intelektualny w&nbsp;sztuce polskiej</em> [The Intellectual Current in Polish Art] (Labirynt Gallery in Lublin, 1984), which gathered the cream of the Polish neo-avant-garde and criticism of the 1970s, is supplemented by Kryszkowski with&nbsp;a&nbsp;list of his own interventions. “At the video screenings, I&nbsp;unscrewed some fuses. One of the artists got hysterical”. A&nbsp;screening of one film “incited [me] to stamp my feet rhythmically, which was instantly picked up by the whole audience. […] But&nbsp;one of the organizers lost his temper, flew into&nbsp;a&nbsp;rage and went for&nbsp;me”. “A windowpane broken by us […] provided one female artist with&nbsp;yet further evidence that&nbsp;our coquettish collaboration with&nbsp;‘the audience in creating the work of art’ was a&nbsp;continuation of the well-known game of illusions from&nbsp;the ‘50s”.<a href="#sdfootnote27sym" name="sdfootnote27anc"><sup>27</sup></a></p> <p>Hooliganism was typical for&nbsp;all those in Kultura Zrzuty, and Kryszkowski practised it in an exceedingly diligent manner.

It should, however, be noted that&nbsp;Kryszkowski, unlike&nbsp;some of his friends, actually did give up the race.

Kryszkowski got rid of “all of the works of art in his possession (created by himself as well as many other Polish and foreign artists) for&nbsp;absurdly low prices; and the rest, the unsold pieces, he threw them, he claims, into&nbsp;the Vistula”.<a href="#sdfootnote32sym" name="sdfootnote32anc"><sup>32</sup></a> As he admitted himself, some of the works were counterfeits, deliberately fabricated: “The prices that&nbsp;were reached by the works that&nbsp;we made copying Warhol, Winiarski or a&nbsp;group of Japanese artists, strengthened our conviction that&nbsp;it was right for&nbsp;us to discard such socially valued skills”.<a href="#sdfootnote33sym" name="sdfootnote33anc"><sup>33</sup></a></p> <p>The strategy of subversion in the field of art did not only include hooliganism or dematerialisation, as it is specifically understood, but&nbsp;also fakes. In the first issue of his magazine <em>Halo Haloo</em>, Kryszkowski included a&nbsp;diploma awarded to Kantor by the communist’s Patriotic Movement for&nbsp;National Rebirth (PRON), offered “in gratitude for&nbsp;his patriotic attitude and active participation in work for&nbsp;the preparation and carrying out of the election campaign for&nbsp;the National Councils of the Capital City and of the Warsaw Province” (dated June 1984).

He had somehow got hold of some original diplomas that&nbsp;PRON awarded celebrated activists.

Kantor, the chief avant-garde artist of the PRL [Polish People’s Republic]”. Libera styled the photograph like&nbsp;a&nbsp;press release from&nbsp;<em>Gazeta Wyborcza</em> dated 4th March 2002. In a&nbsp;comment he remarked: “Some of the pictures were taken especially for&nbsp;this project”.<a href="#sdfootnote37sym" name="sdfootnote37anc"><sup>37</sup></a> The photo does not show Kryszkowski’s face; and is Kantor really Kantor?

As a&nbsp;matter of fact, his idea with&nbsp;Zrzuta was not to “flirt with&nbsp;transgressive art”.<a href="#sdfootnote86sym" name="sdfootnote86anc"><sup>86</sup></a> He perceived the 1981 foundation meeting in Torun as a&nbsp;means of getting out of the artistic career into&nbsp;which they had “stepped like&nbsp;into shit,” towards&nbsp;something that&nbsp;“was incomprehensibly right”.<a href="#sdfootnote87sym" name="sdfootnote87anc"><sup>87</sup></a> For&nbsp;him, “STRYCH was just an attic, a&nbsp;place offering<em> </em>a section of roof, a&nbsp;loo, water and nothing more. Strych did not offer any particular functions and did not expect any special roles or cultural skills from&nbsp;anybody”.<a href="#sdfootnote88sym" name="sdfootnote88anc"><sup>88</sup></a> From&nbsp;his perspective, the “intimate herd” that&nbsp;the company was forming, pursued “activities impossible to IDENTIFY” by “means of culture”.<a href="#sdfootnote89sym" name="sdfootnote89anc"><sup>89</sup></a> Therefore, Kryszkowski contested the very name Kultura Zrzuty and proposed to dilute its essence by giving equal status to the slogans: Zrzuta, Strych, “just a&nbsp;moment, someone pinched my damn briefcase”, and Torun Folk.<a href="#sdfootnote90sym" name="sdfootnote90anc"><sup>90</sup></a> Therefore, he appreciated the gesture of Andrzej “Makary” Wielogórski, who did not want to deliver an essay for&nbsp;an issue of <em>Tango</em> where theoretical deliberations were gathered, prefering to keep silent.<a href="#sdfootnote91sym" name="sdfootnote91anc"><sup>91</sup></a> Paradoxically, it was Kryszkowski who created, with&nbsp;an unparalleled zeal, a&nbsp;string of essays devoted to Zrzuta. He was aware of thet paradox writing: “I also express my definite ABANDONMENT of culture… (which is clear to see) by using its means”. He considered it a&nbsp;necessary compromise so as to make his abandonment visible.<a href="#sdfootnote92sym" name="sdfootnote92anc"><sup>92</sup></a> At the same time he structured Zrzuta as something irrational, eluding any description, narration, categories, words –&nbsp;culture, emphasizing repeatedly that&nbsp;Zrzuta was a&nbsp;practice, not lending itself to description. Hence, he often interrupted his writing just when he was about&nbsp;to proceed with&nbsp;presenting the practical side of the movement.<a href="#sdfootnote93sym" name="sdfootnote93anc"><sup>93</sup></a></p> <p>For this&nbsp;reason he also responded so vigorously when he noticed, in the late ‘80s, that&nbsp;his friends were not going to participate in his construction, and abandon culture.<a href="#sdfootnote94sym" name="sdfootnote94anc"><sup>94</sup></a> After&nbsp;all, as he wrote, even though “it is often ‘accidental’ individuals that&nbsp;get themselves dragged into&nbsp;it”, as a&nbsp;matter of fact “Zrzuta is normally performed among&nbsp;friends”.<a href="#sdfootnote95sym" name="sdfootnote95anc"><sup>95</sup></a> In an essay from&nbsp;1987 he noted a&nbsp;remark by Zofia Łuczko: “If you disturb these people at events, then they are fed up with&nbsp;you.

He commences <em>Hali-Gali</em> with&nbsp;the remark, “the entire magazine, in accordance with&nbsp;the requirements of culture, is dedicated to the needs of the greatest, best and most ambitious authors and artists in our culture, working in such companies as Rowney, Burda, Dior, Marlboro, Mercedes, Pan Am, Fuji, Sony, Talens, etc.”<a href="#sdfootnote103sym" name="sdfootnote103anc"><sup>103</sup></a> Accordingly, he cuts out these and many other brands’ adverts from&nbsp;color magazines and catalogs, and inserts them between&nbsp;the pages of the magazine. With&nbsp;savage painting leading to a&nbsp;successful career in the West, he decides: Zrzuta was “abandoned and wasted” there because “it was not effective and did not contribute to accumulating various achievements and possessions”.<a href="#sdfootnote104sym" name="sdfootnote104anc"><sup>104</sup></a> From&nbsp;the perspective of the West, a&nbsp;participant in Zrzuta assumes the “obscure and embarrassing” position of a&nbsp;“rag” because they are outside&nbsp;the “limiting and instructional fiction of the pattern of a&nbsp;rich, fit man who can do all things”, “a man originating from&nbsp;an advert for&nbsp;powdered milk or an election poster”.<a href="#sdfootnote105sym" name="sdfootnote105anc"><sup>105</sup></a></p> <p>For Kryszkowski, the key to escaping from&nbsp;(consumer) culture is unproductiveness, hooliganism, laziness and chance.

After&nbsp;all, the adverts used in <em>Hali-Gali</em> come from&nbsp;German and French language magazines and catalogues. In communist Poland in the 80s, the compulsion to produce and consume was experienced in other areas not related to the market. Other meanings were produced. This&nbsp;is well depicted in Marcin Król’s confession in the book <em>Podróż romantyczna </em>[A Romantic Journey]:</p> <blockquote> <p>While I&nbsp;am writing these remarks in May 1982 […] I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;feeling of inappropriateness, indecency: people are in prison, others are doing something, they are talking, gathering together, walking, taunting, demonstrating, singing, waiting, condemning, calling, appealing, not sleeping, not eating, buzzing around&nbsp;the city, crying out, speculating, and I&nbsp;am at home, looking out of the window, occasionally concerned for&nbsp;myself, for&nbsp;others; but&nbsp;primarily, I&nbsp;am writing.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote109sym" name="sdfootnote109anc">109</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>If that&nbsp;image were to be compared with&nbsp;another one from&nbsp;the same year, that&nbsp;of the tipsy artists of Kultura Zrzuty chasing a&nbsp;ball in the streets of Warsaw, with&nbsp;stopping off&nbsp;at pubs such as Bazyliszek, Telimena, Zamkowa or Na Trakcie, it would clearly be seen that&nbsp;the escape form culture was an escape from&nbsp;the romantic paradigm and the collective affect prevailing in it, and the situation Zrzuta found itself in had a&nbsp;strong political flavor (and so it was perceived by its members). From&nbsp;this point of view, Kultura Zrzuty was perceived as “a sacrifice on the altar of emptiness”<a href="#sdfootnote110sym" name="sdfootnote110anc"><sup>110</sup></a> as Ryszard Woźniak from&nbsp;Gruppa put it. It is here that&nbsp;the paths of all the participants in Kultura Zrzuty come together, and for&nbsp;whom, an identity-forming work of art was published on the cover of the first issue of <em>Tango</em> (1983). The work was Adam Rzepecki’s work <em>Matka Boska Częstochowska z&nbsp;domalowanymi wąsami</em> [Our Lady of Czestochowa with&nbsp;a&nbsp;Moustache Painted on]<em>. </em>As for&nbsp;Kryszkowski, the desire to be “unidentified” was never placed explicitly in the context of the national and Catholic culture (which is surprising considering&nbsp;his first journalistic essays). At the same time, he retained the scepticism characteristic of the “third way” formation, saying in 1985: “We saw that&nbsp;Solidarity used the same methods that&nbsp;we knew before&nbsp;its formation. […] If it offers its exhibition spaces not only in connection with&nbsp;the Church […] then it also utilizes it for&nbsp;its own purposes, of an equally propagandistic nature, it demands something in return, in a&nbsp;sense it addicts”.<a href="#sdfootnote111sym" name="sdfootnote111anc"><sup>111</sup></a> There is more to it: Kryszkowski himself co-created the anti-national profile of Kultura Zrzuty, for&nbsp;instance as the co-author of the <em>Manifest (o sztukę polską lat osiemdziesiątych)</em> [Manifesto (for Polish Art in the Eighties)]. The manifesto, formed in a&nbsp;postmodernist, non-hierarchical, magma-like sequence, provides this&nbsp;answer (among others) to the initial question of what art in the 80s was like:</p> <blockquote> <p>mystifyingreligiousevenexploitingthefactthattheMOTHEROFGODISTHEQUEENOFPOLAND<br>ritualopentostimulifromsocietyfightingWISEPROMETHEANidealisticnational.<a href="#sdfootnote112sym" name="sdfootnote112anc"><sup>112</sup></a></p> </blockquote> <p>The manifesto is dated 7th June 1982 so it was created in the same month in which Kryszkowski, at the fringe of the <em>Urodziny w&nbsp;Łaźni Miejskiej</em>, announced “booze and football” as the most important achievements of art in the ‘80s. “Zrzuta is too cosmopolitan to revere Polishness or to represent it anywhere”,<a href="#sdfootnote113sym" name="sdfootnote113anc"><sup>113</sup></a> he wrote in 1985. It must be formulated in a&nbsp;sharp tone: the concept of Zrzuta authored by Kryszkowski was focused on the theory of the loss of meaning, an open herd, social constructivism, the contextual treatment of good and evil –&nbsp;and even if it does not explicitly bear an objection to national culture, it still remains in radical axiological opposition to it. “To impose your invention on as many dimwits as possible. And here we have the fundamental imperative of humanism defined […] This&nbsp;Christian imperative… for&nbsp;it is Christian. This&nbsp;is whoredom in humanism. This&nbsp;is the same as imposing your own will, transformed into&nbsp;a&nbsp;product, on others”,<a href="#sdfootnote114sym" name="sdfootnote114anc"><sup>114</sup></a> said Kryszkowski.</p> <p>But there is still another way of looking at the matter. If you accept that&nbsp;the image of society as shown by Król and reproduced in the literature of that&nbsp;period was a&nbsp;falsified image –&nbsp;society presenting itself as it wanted to see itself –&nbsp;then the image of tipsy artists chasing a&nbsp;ball around&nbsp;Warsaw will be one of the many very much demythologizing images of this&nbsp;environment in which they showed (by their own example) the “survival average” under&nbsp;martial law. The image was created very consciously (though that&nbsp;does not mean without&nbsp;genuine pleasure): “We played football in Castle Square. Before&nbsp;us and behind&nbsp;us walked armed ZOMO patrols [Motorized Reserves of the Citizens’ Militia], as well as ORMO [Volunteer Reserve Militia], MO [Citizens’ Militia], WSW [Internal Military Service], SB [Security Service] and LWP [Polish People’s Army] patrols. Kryszkowski, together with&nbsp;Wanda and Kowalska, went to Nowolipki Street”.<a href="#sdfootnote115sym" name="sdfootnote115anc"><sup>115</sup></a><sup></sup></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5300-1-pb-1920x-9d0.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5300-1-pb-330x-e32.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5300-1-pb-660x-250.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5300-1-pb-768x-598.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5300-1-pb-1320x-11a.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5300-1-pb-660x-250.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Cover of <em>O Teofilowie </em>[<em>About Teofilow</em>]</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>Finally, if one of the extremes of the myth of the ‘80s is that&nbsp;identified by Król -&nbsp;i.e. romantic, national and Catholic and full of praise for&nbsp;suffering -&nbsp;then Kultura Zrzuty’s activity with&nbsp;Kryszkowski works in favor of the other extreme -&nbsp;i.e. a&nbsp;specific anti-myth of independent culture crossed with&nbsp;the myth of youth. “The most beautiful period in my life”, Zofia Łuczko would later say of those years. “Holidays in culture”, Zbigniew Bińczyk would comment; both were from&nbsp;the Kultura Zrzuty environment.<a href="#sdfootnote116sym" name="sdfootnote116anc"><sup>116</sup></a> The best rendition of this&nbsp;myth can be found in a&nbsp;book by Andrzej Stasiuk, five years younger than&nbsp;Kryszkowski. <em>Jak zostałem pisarzem </em>[How I&nbsp;Became a&nbsp;Writer] was written in the 1990s, which were subjected to the predatory rhythm of liberal capitalism:</p> <blockquote> <p>The mid-eighties were a&nbsp;land of wonder. Time simply did not exist somehow. Or, in any case, it took the form of rather short sections of time. It lasted from&nbsp;one event to the next, halted and had to start anew. It was probably heading for&nbsp;somewhere but&nbsp;we had the feeling that&nbsp;we would always have enough time and would catch up with&nbsp;it if we needed to. Everywhere was close.

It will never be like&nbsp;that again.<sup><a href="#sdfootnote117sym" name="sdfootnote117anc">117</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Therefore, although Kryszkowski can –&nbsp;and should –&nbsp;be seen as a&nbsp;forgotten link and a&nbsp;unique variant of many traditional links, it should be remembered that&nbsp;Kultura Zrzuty is intrinsically associated with&nbsp;the historical and inimitable mental, political and economic landscape of the ‘80s in Poland. Kryszkowski was aware of this, admitting that&nbsp;martial law promoted the formation of “a hole in culture”.<a href="#sdfootnote118sym" name="sdfootnote118anc"><sup>118</sup></a> And as early as 1986, when independent artists began to gradually enter the official art market, he wrote: “In this&nbsp;destructive practice, culture is more and more tightly filling any gaps within&nbsp;which you could, until&nbsp;just recently, move around&nbsp;freely and independently” and “the wish to meet freely whenever ‘your heart desires’ becomes a&nbsp;sizeable problem”.<a href="#sdfootnote119sym" name="sdfootnote119anc"><sup>119</sup></a> Strych had already ceased to exist by then; therefore, Kryszkowski proposed “one of the pubs in Warsaw” (Samson) as a&nbsp;substitute venue: a&nbsp;place for&nbsp;a&nbsp;“carefree relaxation”, releasing them from&nbsp;“positions of responsibility, organization, tasks and all that&nbsp;crap”.<a href="#sdfootnote120sym" name="sdfootnote120anc"><sup>120</sup></a> But&nbsp;time could not be stopped. Kryszkowski’s ultimate escape from&nbsp;culture can be seen as inseparably embedded within&nbsp;the cogs of the historical process, and Kryszkowski himself as a&nbsp;victim of the democratic transformations: no matter whether he withdrew himself from&nbsp;the new reality because he acclaimed defeat and despised taking part in the race, or because he was afraid to lose the race.</p> <p>As Kryszkowski, on 13th December 1981, had welcomed the unique decade with&nbsp;his own coffin, so he bade farewell to the decade with&nbsp;a&nbsp;grave in 1990. In a&nbsp;presentation of Polish artists abroad, <em>Bakunin w&nbsp;Dreźnie</em> [Bakunin in Dresden], which summed up the ‘80s and announced another ten year period, Kryszkowski ended his participation in the art market by producing a&nbsp;true copy of Mikhail Bakunin’s tomb. Bakunin was -&nbsp;not only for&nbsp;Kultura Zrzuty but&nbsp;also for&nbsp;the alternative movement of the 80s more generally (including Stasiuk as a&nbsp;pacifist artist from&nbsp;the Wolność i&nbsp;Pokój [Freedom and Peace] movement) -&nbsp;one of the symbols of anarchist independence, defined and practised in many ways. The way in which Kryszkowski designed Bakunin’s tombstone<em> </em>is therefore significant: he placed it in the gallery door so that&nbsp;each person entering the gallery had to trample on Bakunin’s tombstone.<a href="#sdfootnote121sym" name="sdfootnote121anc"><sup>121</sup></a></p> <h2>“<b>Masters”</b></h2> <p>Bakunin is the last in the long line of heroes whose lives and work Kryszkowski made a&nbsp;reference point for&nbsp;Zrzuta.<a href="#sdfootnote122sym" name="sdfootnote122anc"><sup>122</sup></a> The essays devoted to them are acts of special creation, blurring the boundaries between&nbsp;biographical fact and literary fiction, in accordance with&nbsp;Kryszkowski’s suggestion to “use characters for&nbsp;the history being produced”.<a href="#sdfootnote123sym" name="sdfootnote123anc"><sup>123</sup></a> It does not mean that&nbsp;they are heroes totally devoid of the predispositions expected by Kryszkowski. The anti-establishment attitude and enigmatic personality of the “king of Krakowskie Przedmieście” made Andrzej Partum the patron of the Kultura Zrzuty circle long before&nbsp;he was made one of the “masters” by Zbigniew Libera in his counter-history. “In this&nbsp;history of Polish art I&nbsp;am most interested in that&nbsp;which it did not want to notice, or mistreated, in the name of various selections”, stated Kryszkowski in 1985, placing Partum among&nbsp;the heroes of his own counter-history of art, blurring the boundaries between&nbsp;truth and fiction.<a href="#sdfootnote124sym" name="sdfootnote124anc"><sup>124</sup></a></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5306-1-pb-1920x-e72.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5306-1-pb-330x-fd3.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5306-1-pb-660x-28a.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5306-1-pb-768x-61e.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5306-1-pb-1320x-665.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2016/13/jacek-kryszkowski/366-5306-1-pb-660x-28a.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p><em>Pałowanie ‘82</em><span> [Truncheoning ‘82]. </span><span>The frame from&nbsp;the film </span><em>Państwo wojny<span> </span></em><span>[The War State],</span><em><span> </span></em><span>a collective work edited by Józef Robakowski, 1982</span></p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>Kryszkowski referred to Johannes Baader<a href="#sdfootnote125sym" name="sdfootnote125anc"><sup>125</sup></a> above&nbsp;all, it seems, to establish his own independence from&nbsp;Dadaism in the field of inspiration –&nbsp;the fundamental inspiration both for&nbsp;him and all those in Kultura Zrzuty and many independent formations of the ‘80s. Kryszkowski called Duchamp a&nbsp;“culture slut:”<a href="#sdfootnote126sym" name="sdfootnote126anc"><sup>126</sup></a> when considering&nbsp;the career of anti-art “at the contests and bankers’ parlours of New York”,<a href="#sdfootnote127sym" name="sdfootnote127anc"><sup>127</sup></a> one has to admit that&nbsp;this patricide was well within&nbsp;the field of culture criticism pursued by Kryszkowski. Duchamp, in his opinion, did not cross the boundary beyond&nbsp;which a&nbsp;work of art is redundant and the positions of the artist and art get annihilated. Therefore, Kryszkowski contrasted the “Duchampian tradition of the struggle for&nbsp;success in nature”<a href="#sdfootnote128sym" name="sdfootnote128anc"><sup>128</sup></a> with&nbsp;Zrzuta; and in the bosom of Dada he chose the most enigmatic person to be patron.</p> <p>Finally, Witkacy.
