				<section class="u-typo">   <p>In 2012 Donald Trump referred to climate change as a&nbsp;“myth” propagated by the Chinese, and campaigned for&nbsp;US withdrawal from&nbsp;the Paris Agreement, a&nbsp;pledge he later fulfilled.<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a> Subsequently, on taking office as US President, Trump continued to reportedly call climate change a&nbsp;“hoax”<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a> and the <em>New Scientist</em> reported on his selection of a&nbsp;climate change denier to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and a&nbsp;leader of the energy department who had suggested dissolving it.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a> Trump used and continues to use social media to belittle climate change as an unnecessary, illogical expense for&nbsp;the US:</p> <blockquote>In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a&nbsp;little bit of that&nbsp;good old Global Warming that&nbsp;our Country, but&nbsp;not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! (@realDonaldTrump, Dec 29, 2017)</blockquote> <p>Scholarly climate research is jeopardized when world leaders reject scientific evidence. Therefore, the imaginations of artists are more critical than&nbsp;ever before, when science is slurred by politicized strategies of igniting uncertainty by the military-industrial complex. It is not presenting additional objective data that&nbsp;is needed politically in this&nbsp;context, as this&nbsp;has been attempted, it is imagination, fantasy, humor, emotion and satire, that&nbsp;can poke and provoke through&nbsp;visualizing climate change insistently. In order for&nbsp;visualization to occur we need, as Nicholas Mirzoeff has urged, “to learn to see the Anthropocene.”<a href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a></p> <p>In this&nbsp;article I&nbsp;will be considering&nbsp;contemporary paintings by American artist Alexis Rockman (born 1962, New York) under&nbsp;the proposition of the Anthropocene and provide a&nbsp;commentary upon&nbsp;ironies the concept encapsulates as played out in his visual imagery and iconography of the human, nonhuman and posthuman. I&nbsp;focus on Rockman’s paintings from&nbsp;the global South that&nbsp;encompass visual metonyms of capture, which snare the human as trapped in “his” own Anthropocene. Rockman uses self-portraiture to represent his artistic and ethical predicaments during&nbsp;expeditions that&nbsp;re-enact past&nbsp;artist-colonial exploration and the tensions of capturing nature through&nbsp;representation. I&nbsp;extend T.J. Demos’ understanding of “decolonization” to Rockman’s work, baring serious dilemmas, and argue for&nbsp;both painting and the human figure to be included in the emerging Anthropocene art field, and for&nbsp;the importance of artistic engagement with&nbsp;the Anthropocene to support fellow scientists who are pitted against&nbsp;political impediments.</p> <p>This article understands the Anthropocene not only as denoting the human species becoming a&nbsp;geological force as first conceived by Earth System Science (ESS),<a href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a> but&nbsp;also considers the concept’s social and political ramifications. Extractivist global capitalism’s pursuit of economic growth through&nbsp;Western notions of progress operationally removes obstacles to development, such as rainforests for&nbsp;monocrop agricultural production or by expropriating indigenous communities’ land through&nbsp;coercion or ruination of ecosystems, and nature reconceived as resource. In this&nbsp;context colonialism is continued through&nbsp;multinational corporations and state-financed mining programs.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a> Extreme weather events caused by anthropogenic climate change are widespread and effect both hemispheres, however across&nbsp;geographies it is the wealthy who have the biggest chance of survival and the vulnerable are left unaided. These social inequalities, blind-spots and disharmonies pulsate through&nbsp;Anthropocene discourse. I&nbsp;argue here that&nbsp;Alexis Rockman visualizes these injustices in the Americas and complicates them through&nbsp;self-mockery and self-implication in narrative-based self-portraits that&nbsp;reveal the role the Western white male holds within&nbsp;an ideology that&nbsp;captures nonhumans and humans alike.</p> <p>For the past&nbsp;two decades, Rockman’s work has been discussed using environmental, ecological or natural history terminology alongside references to visual culture. However, the Anthropocene concept is now being retrospectively applied. Joanna Marsh, curator and Head of Interpretation and Audience Research at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, teases out Anthropocene tropes in the dystopic futurity of Rockman’s paintings of urbanization and infrastructure within&nbsp;his home city New York. Whilst Marsh concentrates on Rockman’s built environments and lambasting of American expansionism,<a href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a> I&nbsp;extend Rockman’s critique of expansionist ambitions beyond&nbsp;US metropolises and focus on how he visualizes the human, the <em>Anthropos</em>,<em> </em>which is the etymological root of the Anthropocene. I&nbsp;would contend that&nbsp;Rockman is among&nbsp;few artists using pictorial representations of the human form in the context of the Anthropocene, albeit in one painting series in particular, and it is this&nbsp;series that&nbsp;this article will examine.</p> <h2>Anthropocenic Painting</h2> <p>Following the explosion in Anthropocene discourse across&nbsp;fields of study, spreading from&nbsp;ESS origins, there is need for&nbsp;an enquiry into&nbsp;how contemporary painting is engaging with&nbsp;the tropes and contradictions the Anthropocene encompasses. This&nbsp;can be demonstrated in the engagement with&nbsp;paint materiality and pigment provenance by artists Sigrid Holmwood, Onya McCausland, Maria Lalić and Ulrike Arnold –&nbsp;what Jussi Parikka might call a&nbsp;geology<a href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a> of painting, and the research methods and material enquiries used by pedology experts and artists in the publication <em>Field to Palette: Dialogues on Soil and Art in the Anthropocene</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a> Additional examples of Anthropocenic painting might include artists investigating sustainable materials, recyclables and “natural” dyes such as in the work of Liz Elton; the agency of natural processes and water used in Vivian Suter’s, Peter Matthews’ and Jessica Warboys’ canvases; nuclear aesthetics as explored by James Rosenquist, Yelena Popova and Adrian Ghenie; speculative landscapes in contemporary imaginings by Amelia Carley; built environment ecologies and concrete jungles in Adriano Valeri’s, Luiz Zerbini’s and Daniel Richter’s paintings; and geology and sedimentation in Per Kirkeby’s, Laura Moriarty’s and Barbara Nicholls’ work.</p> <p>In contrast, T.J. Demos suggests that&nbsp;much of the imagery visualizing and documenting the Anthropocene is quasi-scientific, satellite-based, remote-sensored or composite.<a href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a> These technologies possess authorial agendas but&nbsp;refrain from&nbsp;disclosing them and feature no visible or identifiable human subject. Through&nbsp;these technologies humans appear to be visualizing “nature” at a&nbsp;distance from&nbsp;themselves, or using aerial photography or drone operation, where “nature” is looked down&nbsp;upon from&nbsp;a&nbsp;God-like perspective, such as in the “disaster capitalism”<a href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a> or “Anthrobscene”<a href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a> photography and film work of Edward Burtynsky, which holds a&nbsp;sublime hyper-aesthetic appeal.</p> <p>These distancing mechanisms could be seen as continuing the European Western landscape painting genre (landscape as proxy for&nbsp;“nature”), whereby nature is depicted as an inert backdrop to human activity, a&nbsp;static set or “back screen.”<a href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a> Nature in this&nbsp;tradition has been visualized as mastered, conserved, managed or revered, viewed in awe and/or fear, but&nbsp;always at safe distance. This&nbsp;visually secure detachment has created a&nbsp;Western cognitive habit of visualizing nature as removed, othered, permitting its colonization both in terms of controlling nature, but&nbsp;also appropriating new lands, and with&nbsp;that, people.<a href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a> However, this&nbsp;alienation is now upturned and contrary to the Anthropocene’s paradigmatic swing of interpreting humans as embedded with&nbsp;and in nature and expelling the distinction between. Therefore, if Anthropocene visualizations are to oblige the concept’s proposition, the human -&nbsp;I&nbsp;argue -&nbsp;should not be centered as the only lively entity against&nbsp;a&nbsp;vapid background as compounded by humanism, but&nbsp;also not entirely absent either.</p> <p>The Anthropocene thesis has also prompted analysis of the convoluted temporalities of the geological deep time of fossil fuels combusted quickly in the present, discharging anxieties about&nbsp;speculative futures. How to summon these temporal intricacies becomes important in various art practices. In socially engaged art and activist collectives such as Art Not Oil (which include Liberate Tate and other groups) and Platform, the documentation of participation, protest or performance, records the enacted social, political and/or ecological message, and survives beyond&nbsp;the moment of live activity, which underscores these creative strategies. The onlooker of “relational aesthetics”<a href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a> becomes a&nbsp;participant through&nbsp;modes of social interstice and encounter; however, this&nbsp;relationality is determined by the temporal duration of the activity, which once finished, similarly to performance art, relies on documentation to evidence what has occurred while the social relationality ceases, which is the <em>raison d’être</em> of the aesthetics. The media documentation re-presents the past&nbsp;activity in a&nbsp;different form. Whereas in painting and other visual art, viewing occurs at a&nbsp;moment established in the present but&nbsp;it can unfold with&nbsp;temporal possibilities in the phenomenological viewing experience, oscillating between&nbsp;past, present and future imaginings, sometimes concurrently. More significantly, the duration of viewing a&nbsp;painting is undefined; it is nonlinear and flexible. The time of the painting’s final image and the time of its making are also unsynchronized. The viewer determines their temporal engagement. Painting keeps time elastic, it accumulates time through&nbsp;making, which is often a&nbsp;different time to its public release and it is a&nbsp;“time battery” that&nbsp;marks and stores time “which remains present on its surfaces, since&nbsp;its constituent marks, which are laid down&nbsp;over time, are always simultaneously available to vision.”<a href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a> I&nbsp;therefore suggest this&nbsp;fluidity in the temporal viewing experience, within&nbsp;the supposed bounded object of painting, can address Anthropocene temporalities.</p> <p>Demos urges for&nbsp;a&nbsp;“decolonization” performed through&nbsp;visual culture that&nbsp;does not reside in “institutional” gallery-based contemplations of the aesthetic, folded in his view within&nbsp;the same destructive capitalist networks, but&nbsp;through interdisciplinary modes mirroring “political ecology.”<a href="#sdfootnote17sym" name="sdfootnote17anc"><sup>17</sup></a> Whilst celebrating the broadness of visual culture addressing climate change and the Anthropocene through&nbsp;activism outside&nbsp;institutional art practice, he completely (perhaps deliberately) misses out painting and its possibilities, which do not have to be entirely studio-bound or gallery-based.<a href="#sdfootnote18sym" name="sdfootnote18anc"><sup>18</sup></a> Demos demands an aesthetic and ethico-political art marriage, yet the examples he offers, I&nbsp;would argue, are skewed towards&nbsp;the latter. I&nbsp;would also challenge the demonization of the gallery-based ecology, as this&nbsp;condemnation prioritizes one aesthetic and audience, whereas Rockman for&nbsp;instance, conducts field research, interdisciplinary connection, a&nbsp;rejection of the myth of “high art” elitism to engage an art and non-art public<a href="#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc"><sup>19</sup></a> through&nbsp;gallery and public museum systems. He also creates illustrations for&nbsp;nature magazines, drawings for&nbsp;commercial films, and public billboard commissions. Rockman uses his didactic populist imagery in an attempt to educate and be accessible to a&nbsp;wide audience through&nbsp;luxurious pictorialism to pedagogically make an impact within&nbsp;a&nbsp;society where heads of state harangue climate action. His technical bravado, bitter humor and high-chroma all fight for&nbsp;attention against&nbsp;social media propaganda to support the sciences.<a href="#sdfootnote20sym" name="sdfootnote20anc"><sup>20</sup></a></p> <h2>The Capitalocene, Painting and Humans</h2> <p>Widely held analysis in critical art history and theory deems painting (and other “plastic arts”) to operate within&nbsp;the commercialized art market<a href="#sdfootnote21sym" name="sdfootnote21anc"><sup>21</sup></a> as a&nbsp;commodity that&nbsp;bolsters globalized capital through&nbsp;production, circulation, distribution and exorbitant wealth exchange, supported by neoliberal financial systems of insurance, taxation, customs, duties, visas, logistics, shipping, sponsorship, ownership, administration and information technology; the Capitalocene.<a href="#sdfootnote22sym" name="sdfootnote22anc"><sup>22</sup></a> These indictments have resulted in recent appeals for&nbsp;painting to <em>visualize</em> its distribution and exhibition “networks,”<a href="#sdfootnote23sym" name="sdfootnote23anc"><sup>23</sup></a> previously vented in 1960s’ and 1970s’ dematerialization of the art object as Conceptual Art recoiled from&nbsp;the plenitude of existing products, but&nbsp;happily borrowed Minimalist aesthetics.</p> <p>Therefore today, there is good reason for&nbsp;reterritorialization in painting that&nbsp;openly highlights the complicity experienced as both consumer and producer-artist, in a&nbsp;networked system that&nbsp;one could strongly contend anthropogenically contributes to climate change through&nbsp;resource use, waste and perpetuating the Anthropocene’s inequalities of wealth, politicized inertia and privilege. In critically reflecting on contemporary painting’s engagement with&nbsp;the Anthropocene debate, one possibility is to explicitly highlight its human authorship. When you behold a&nbsp;painting, rudimentary understandings of the link to its human creator could be one or more of the following: the painter is perceived through&nbsp;a&nbsp;scrawled surface signature; indexical brushstrokes trace the painter’s gestures and the viewer attempts to virtually re-enact the painting’s genealogy by observation of the mark-making;<a href="#sdfootnote24sym" name="sdfootnote24anc"><sup>24</sup></a> vitalist projections of painting becoming a&nbsp;“manifestation of the absent author”<a href="#sdfootnote25sym" name="sdfootnote25anc"><sup>25</sup></a> and their Marxian “living labor” and lifetime are “<em>seemingly</em> stored in it”<a href="#sdfootnote26sym" name="sdfootnote26anc"><sup>26</sup></a> creating value as commodity form and charging paintings with&nbsp;“subject-like qualities”;<a href="#sdfootnote27sym" name="sdfootnote27anc"><sup>27</sup></a> the painting’s facture, which in European 18th and 19th-century modern art characterized the artist’s individuation and “style”; in material-ambered hair or fingerprint traces; and, most obviously, through&nbsp;self-portraiture.</p> <p>Following on from&nbsp;this, a&nbsp;human author can be inferred in part of the painting making process, no matter how remotely, technologically or digitally generated. Painting as ontology unfurls the meaning of the Anthropocene as a&nbsp;geological signature of the human on a&nbsp;planetary scale within&nbsp;paint application. Human cultural engagement with&nbsp;environments is prehistoric: ever since&nbsp;our species began mark-marking we have been engaged with&nbsp;Earth pigments, in caves and on bodies, and as geologist Ruth Siddall adds, “the procurement, preparation and application of ochres is arguably the earliest exploitation of Earth materials.”<a href="#sdfootnote28sym" name="sdfootnote28anc"><sup>28</sup></a> Therefore, the activity of painting is directly connected to manipulation of the Earth. Burtynsky calls the Anthropocene the “indelible human signature.”<a href="#sdfootnote29sym" name="sdfootnote29anc"><sup>29</sup></a> I&nbsp;would argue that&nbsp;the Anthropocene creates distaste for&nbsp;the human, an embarrassment perhaps, or knowing reminder that&nbsp;humans (not all of course) have overproduced to an entropic magnitude. This&nbsp;“Great Acceleration” of excess has also propelled human population size, energy consumption, urban populace, mega-dams, water usage, paper production, telecommunications, fertilizer dependency, transportation, international tourism, methane levels, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide use, tropical forest loss, shrimp aquaculture, and many more. These fast-paced upward propulsions since&nbsp;1950 have been dramatically and graphically visualized,<a href="#sdfootnote30sym" name="sdfootnote30anc"><sup>30</sup></a> curving continually upwards throughout Rockman’s lifetime.</p> <p>In tackling the baffling question <em>What is Nature?<a href="#sdfootnote31sym" name="sdfootnote31anc"><sup>31</sup></a></em> Kate Soper convincingly argues that&nbsp;despite the pressure and perhaps desire to adopt post-anthropocentrism, humans are always going to present an anthropocentric view. This&nbsp;poses problems for&nbsp;the different philosophies of speculative realism and object-orientated ontology, new materialisms, animism, posthumanism and panpsychism, all poised towards&nbsp;an attempt to remove anthropocentric blinkers. If, as Michael Sanchez writes, “visibility can be equated with&nbsp;legitimation,”<a href="#sdfootnote32sym" name="sdfootnote32anc"><sup>32</sup></a> the deficiency of self-imagining within&nbsp;Anthropocene visuals, I&nbsp;suggest, erases human self-presence, perhaps warping interpretations of contribution, responsibility and involvement, but&nbsp;also cogent acknowledgment of the human connection to biological, ecological, socio-political, technological and economic systems within&nbsp;the Anthropocene. Self-representation does not have to be a&nbsp;formula or forum for&nbsp;a&nbsp;subject’s expressed guilt, pity or confession in light of socio-economic and environmental biases in the Anthropocene, but&nbsp;recognition of complexity whereby citizens in rich-countries<a href="#sdfootnote33sym" name="sdfootnote33anc"><sup>33</sup></a> visualize perceptions of relations to nonhumans and other living and non-living organisms. I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to stress then that&nbsp;painting (embracing expanded and interdisciplinary practices) <em>and</em> its human creator, as well as its machines and technologies, through&nbsp;whichever mode (digital or analogue), should not be missing from&nbsp;the Anthropocene visual canon, as there is justification to include both.</p> <h2>Thwarting Anthropocene Visualization</h2> <p>The difficulty of visualizing the Anthropocene has been expressed by many theorists. Jean-Luc Nancy maintains that&nbsp;humans have lost the ability to form an “image of the world” as it is “hypercomplex”<a href="#sdfootnote34sym" name="sdfootnote34anc"><sup>34</sup></a> and questions whether this&nbsp;results (whilst in conversation) in what John Paul Ricco calls “a picturing of the world through&nbsp;which humans take humanity out of (the picture of) the world?”<a href="#sdfootnote35sym" name="sdfootnote35anc"><sup>35</sup></a> Due to this&nbsp;complication, Nancy suggests that&nbsp;humanity is now in a&nbsp;position beyond&nbsp;representation and only has an <em>idea</em> of the world, not an image. The paradox Ricco points out is the “image of humanity’s erasing of the human from&nbsp;geologic time that&nbsp;in part accompanies the assertion of the Anthropocene.”<a href="#sdfootnote36sym" name="sdfootnote36anc"><sup>36</sup></a> In other words, in naming the Anthropocene, humans both write themselves into&nbsp;geologic time and visualize themselves out through&nbsp;the prospect of becoming the next Sixth Mass Extinction event.<a href="#sdfootnote37sym" name="sdfootnote37anc"><sup>37</sup></a></p> <p>The scalar anthropogenic planetary-system changes in the stratosphere for&nbsp;instance, or in remote locations such as Antarctica, are hard to visualize and comprehend. Timothy Morton christens these vast phenomena “hyperobjects” as “they so massively outscale us, [and] have magnified this&nbsp;weirdness of things for&nbsp;our inspection: things are themselves, but&nbsp;we can’t point to them directly.”<a href="#sdfootnote38sym" name="sdfootnote38anc"><sup>38</sup></a> Nixon similarly remarks on this&nbsp;struggle:</p> <blockquote>How can we convert into&nbsp;image and narrative the disasters that&nbsp;are slow moving and long in the making, disasters that&nbsp;are anonymous and that&nbsp;star nobody, disasters that&nbsp;are attritional and of indifferent interest to the sensation-driven technologies of our image-world? How can we turn the long emergencies of slow violence into&nbsp;stories dramatic enough to rouse public sentiment and warrant political intervention […]?<a href="#sdfootnote39sym" name="sdfootnote39anc"><sup>39</sup></a></blockquote> <p>However, despite&nbsp;these complex, slow, accelerated, and spatially vast obstacles outlined above, visualization is not wholly irresolvable. Throughout the history of Western painting, visualizing the invisible has been tackled through&nbsp;several means: Judeo-Christian symbolism and iconography developed for&nbsp;representing divinity and the Holy Trinity; Renaissance linear perspective to condition illusions of spatiality and depth; channeling of eidetic and entoptical imagery and other neuro-physiological phenomena; influence from&nbsp;spiritualist literature, theosophy and occultism to produce visionary paintings -&nbsp;these are but&nbsp;a&nbsp;few examples.<a href="#sdfootnote40sym" name="sdfootnote40anc"><sup>40</sup></a></p> <p>The spatial and temporal hurdles complicated by the Anthropocene still problematize visualization, which is reliant on scientific modelling. Climate change, for&nbsp;instance, is measured by climate scientists using data from&nbsp;the past&nbsp;to calculate future climate. Researcher Adam Brenthel has argued that&nbsp;climate (as opposed to weather) cannot be visualized for&nbsp;present purposes,<a href="#sdfootnote41sym" name="sdfootnote41anc"><sup>41</sup></a> as scientific predictions are future-orientated, and he also contends that&nbsp;visualization of the future should be temporally represented, not spatially as landscape for&nbsp;example, and accurate future forecasting is almost impossible, particularly if tipping points transform the planet beyond&nbsp;human comprehension.<a href="#sdfootnote42sym" name="sdfootnote42anc"><sup>42</sup></a> However, the priorities for&nbsp;Brenthel are to communicate climate change in order to foster responsive action through&nbsp;visualizations so as to influence the public and policymakers, and he argues this&nbsp;is achievable by aesthetic images being “supplementary” to scientific images.<a href="#sdfootnote43sym" name="sdfootnote43anc"><sup>43</sup></a> Whereas for&nbsp;our purposes here, aesthetic images do not need to be supplements, in Rockman’s paintings they combine, or ingest, scientific research, bringing together the fictive and factual in one. Additionally, local or grounded manifestations of environmental change can be detected, visualized or textualized, such as those empirically observed by Rachel Carson in <em>Silent Spring</em><a href="#sdfootnote44sym" name="sdfootnote44anc"><sup>44</sup></a> where the decline in birdlife in US communities prompted her to mix literary fable with&nbsp;scientific research, recording the effects of the pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), most famously in her first chapter <em>A Fable for&nbsp;Tomorrow, </em>a title later borrowed for&nbsp;an Alexis Rockman publication and exhibition.<a href="#sdfootnote45sym" name="sdfootnote45anc"><sup>45</sup></a></p> <h2>Apparatuses of Capture</h2> <p>Human occularism, and the “seeing is believing” Western scopic regime, seem at odds in the Anthropocene where changes to Earth system cycles test the naked eye. The accelerated presence of radionuclides in the atmosphere post-1950 is the likely “golden spike” the Anthropocene Working Group will formally seek to date the Anthropocene from. Atsuhide Ito reaffirms that&nbsp;visualizing the hyperobject of radioactivity is antagonistic to the biological mechanism of the eye. The invisibility of high frequency short-wavelengths requires technological intervention to detect and represent (e.g. via&nbsp;a&nbsp;Geiger counter). Ito presents the case study of filmmaker Vladimir Shevchenko, who filmed in Chernobyl after&nbsp;the nuclear disaster in 1986, and whose very film revealed evidence of radioactive interference. Shevchenko and his equipment were exposed to radiation and he died one year later. Quoting Ito at length:</p> <blockquote>The operator of the apparatus of capture becomes captured as an indexical representation of radiation. In a&nbsp;paradoxical way the human subject who attempts to capture a&nbsp;form of energy to translate it into&nbsp;visuality becomes the outcome of the process. Through&nbsp;this […] the subject becomes a&nbsp;medium and an outcome of the photographic process and, conversely, skeletonizes their ontological impossibility of being in its material and physical body immersed in the field of ionizing radioactivity that&nbsp;destroys their atomic structure.<a href="#sdfootnote46sym" name="sdfootnote46anc"><sup>46</sup></a></blockquote> <p></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_only-youjpg-1920x-ff2.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_only-youjpg-330x-2e4.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_only-youjpg-660x-24c.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_only-youjpg-768x-620.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_only-youjpg-1320x-8a8.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_only-youjpg-660x-24c.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Alexis Rockman, <em>Only You</em>, 2008.

Christ’s body is gangrenous and symptomatic and the Rye plant (<em>Secale cereale</em>) takes root in Rockman’s work as a&nbsp;nod to this&nbsp;artistic piracy.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/erste_schauseite_des_isenheimer_altars-1920x-5f1.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/erste_schauseite_des_isenheimer_altars-330x-1ca.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/erste_schauseite_des_isenheimer_altars-660x-ee6.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/erste_schauseite_des_isenheimer_altars-768x-cdc.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/erste_schauseite_des_isenheimer_altars-1320x-930.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/erste_schauseite_des_isenheimer_altars-660x-ee6.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p><em>The Isenheim Altarpiece</em>, c.1512-15 (oil on panel), Grunewald, Matthias (Mathis Nithart Gothart) (c.1480-1528) / Musee d'Unterlinden, Colmar, France / Bridgeman Images.

It is no longer indigenous people and nonhumans deemed out of place, but&nbsp;the lost, Western, eco do-gooder male artist, fallen in terrain he is ill-equipped for. Nixon views ecotourism, designed for&nbsp;privileged rich-country citizens, as a&nbsp;continuation of the slow violence and environmentalism of the poor in the global South, where locations are green-washed and local communities segregated from&nbsp;resources (which are depleted) and dispossessed of their ways of life. Forms of neoliberal tourism resume imperialist incursions within&nbsp;cultural globalization and mediatization,<a href="#sdfootnote68sym" name="sdfootnote68anc"><sup>68</sup></a> and landscape itself becomes a&nbsp;commodity and packaged for&nbsp;tours.<a href="#sdfootnote69sym" name="sdfootnote69anc"><sup>69</sup></a></p> <p>I would like&nbsp;to advance that&nbsp;Alexis Rockman re-casts the casualties of the former (and arguably continuing) colonization of the New World (through ecological resource imperialism, outsourcing of environmental waste, dispossession, displacement,<a href="#sdfootnote70sym" name="sdfootnote70anc"><sup>70</sup></a> militarism, and nuclear colonization), where Amerindians fell victim to introduced epidemics of small pox, measles, influenza and other pathogens.<a href="#sdfootnote71sym" name="sdfootnote71anc"><sup>71</sup></a> Here, Rockman offers his own body as a&nbsp;site for&nbsp;colony and conquest, and reoccupation or repatriation by the forest in providing it with&nbsp;nourishment. Nature is re-colonizing the artist’s deceased body in the forms of Carrion beetle and Blue Bottle fly, magnified in the foreground, and a&nbsp;King vulture and Turkey vulture await their gains. Rockman reverses the outcome of the first exploits of people and nature in the Americas, re-enacting them in the same location where the intrepid explorer is now made vulnerable, lost, prone to infection, and ultimately expires.</p> <p>Writing for&nbsp;the inauguration of the new science and technology museum La Cité de la Villette in Paris in 1986, Paul Virilio argued that&nbsp;museum displays should make accommodations<em> </em>for accident, since&nbsp;each new technology is accompanied by a&nbsp;novel catastrophe, for&nbsp;instance the automobile is complemented by the car crash, the sea vessel beckons the shipwreck. Virilio believes “what is needed is a&nbsp;new scenography where only <em>what is exploding or decomposing is exhibited</em><em>. </em>A paradoxical <em>mise-en-scène </em>of the obscene, where decomposition and disintegration follow artistic display and high-tech design.”<a href="#sdfootnote72sym" name="sdfootnote72anc"><sup>72</sup></a> In the context of the Anthropocene where humanity’s existence is perceived to be perilous, decomposition should be visualized perhaps more than&nbsp;composition, and the human body and its inseparability with&nbsp;death should also be respected.<a href="#sdfootnote73sym" name="sdfootnote73anc"><sup>73</sup></a> In Rockman’s case his body is exposed, a&nbsp;taboo for&nbsp;some, and without&nbsp;burial or ceremony, and it is visualized as material that&nbsp;is dematerializing. In <em>The</em> <em>Ecotourist</em> the dead linger, not entombed away but&nbsp;juxtaposed amongst the living in the lively rainforest as existence continues. The terminated are frequently featured in Rockman’s work as road kill, predator-prey tussles or returning extinct species in paintings where death for&nbsp;nonhuman animals is inescapably part of life. In <em>The Ecotourist</em>, an identification key (an interpretational device borrowed from&nbsp;museum displays) lists <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> alongside nonhumans, democratizing species and equalizing the dead and the living. However, anthropocentric taxonomic classifications intended for&nbsp;and only interpreted by humans, are further made ironic in a&nbsp;potential posthuman Anthropocene.</p> <p>When the viewer is not provided with&nbsp;a&nbsp;“key” to meaning, Rockman’s work operates in a&nbsp;similar vein to Dario Gamboni’s “hidden images,” which draw upon&nbsp;Jean-Didier Urbain’s “crypto-images.” These operate as puzzles to be deciphered. In Gamboni’s analysis the beholder is provided with&nbsp;information with&nbsp;a&nbsp;“specific intention” to communicate its content, but&nbsp;it also has “been subject to a&nbsp;form of censorship” or withdraws from&nbsp;full disclosure so ambiguity still fizzes.<a href="#sdfootnote74sym" name="sdfootnote74anc"><sup>74</sup></a> As soon as hidden images achieve revelation, however, their mystery weakens and their job is complete. This&nbsp;“coding and decoding” is a&nbsp;game Rockman revels in.</p> <p><em>The Ecotourist</em> crystallizes in diorama format, first patented by Louis Daguerre in 1822, and originally designed as what Kevin Avery describes as “landscape theatre,”<a href="#sdfootnote75sym" name="sdfootnote75anc"><sup>75</sup></a> a&nbsp;mode of advertised entertainment for&nbsp;the audience’s mnemonic travel or as a&nbsp;fantasy “travel machine” as Virilio describes Daguerre’s Paris Diorama.<a href="#sdfootnote76sym" name="sdfootnote76anc"><sup>76</sup></a> Rockman’s dioramas borrow the aesthetics of natural history museological displays, which often include taxidermy specimens that&nbsp;are “real,” dead and fabricated. He is captivated by those in the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where his mother worked as assistant to anthropologist Margaret Mead. Avery views Rockman’s dioramas as being closer to the inanimate genre of still life. I&nbsp;would also champion this&nbsp;analysis and extend it further as the material encasement of <em>The Ecotourist</em> traps a&nbsp;mix of “readymade” organic and inorganic material, sealed in layers of synthetic resin with&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital photograph as backdrop, and in between&nbsp;the veneers Rockman inserts his own hand-painted imagery.<a href="#sdfootnote77sym" name="sdfootnote77anc"><sup>77</sup></a> These vitrine-like painting-objects hybridize real and fake, biological and artificial, two and three dimensions, complicating what is now considered natural since&nbsp;the human is geologic.</p> <p>After visiting the exhibition <em>Amber: Window to the Past</em> at the American Museum of Natural History in 1996, Rockman became fascinated by the gummed amber insects as “moments trapped in time”<a href="#sdfootnote78sym" name="sdfootnote78anc"><sup>78</sup></a> and the capturing of time in Rockman’s work resounds throughout his projects. Amber transmutes into&nbsp;viscid polymer in his dioramic cases of temporality that&nbsp;evoke the strata of evidence the Anthropocene Working Group are tasked with&nbsp;finding. Therefore, Rockman’s dioramas of still life are assemblages of “readymade” material, capturing life, <em>nature morte</em> or dead nature.</p> <h2>Tropical Hazards</h2>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_tropical_hazards-1920x-55d.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_tropical_hazards-330x-a54.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_tropical_hazards-660x-960.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_tropical_hazards-768x-dc9.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_tropical_hazards-1320x-43b.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_tropical_hazards-660x-960.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Alexis Rockman, <em>Tropical Hazards</em>, 2000.

The posturing “macho” artist, again a&nbsp;self-portrait, soils his own “image” and painting surface. I&nbsp;would argue that&nbsp;Rockman mocks himself, and New York School painting, by instead preferring small-brush precision and stylized execution. The artist consulted experts in molecular biology and tropical medicine to harness the fears of exotic travel and naivety of the adventure-seeker, illustrating parasites and health risks he did and did not experience: Hookworm, Electric Eels, Banana Vipers and Candiru.<a href="#sdfootnote80sym" name="sdfootnote80anc"><sup>80</sup></a> Rockman’s body acts as a&nbsp;host for&nbsp;microorganism colonization and outbreak, which I&nbsp;suggest ridicules one-species hegemony, illustrating the human body as “a multiplicity of beings (including the bacteriological) all enmeshed within&nbsp;complex multispecies ecologies.”<a href="#sdfootnote81sym" name="sdfootnote81anc"><sup>81</sup></a></p> <p>David Joselit argues that&nbsp;since the 1990s the human body has expanded through&nbsp;connectivity via&nbsp;digital means and networks, and simultaneously tapered through&nbsp;microscopic reduction to DNA –&nbsp;contractions manifested through&nbsp;the Internet and Human Genome project. The human body becomes transformed as Cyborg or Posthuman through&nbsp;technological extensions of the body, which Joselit terms “biocollage.”<a href="#sdfootnote82sym" name="sdfootnote82anc"><sup>82</sup></a> Adapting Joselit’s notion of “biocollage” and uncertainty over&nbsp;subjectivity and embodiment, in <em>Tropical Hazards</em> the taut human body simultaneously bulges with&nbsp;microscopic hosts and projects <em>outwardly</em> from&nbsp;its “normal” corpus, and the microbiological visualizations of bacteria in petri-dishes portray the body <em>inwardly</em>, as the supposed single subject becomes a&nbsp;biocollage of many.</p> <p>Addressing images outside&nbsp;the Western fine art history canon (“outsider,” anti-art, postcolonial and popular culture) art historian James Elkins considers “informational images” to be neglected visual forms. These include graphs, maps, charts, plans, official documents, technical and architectural drawings, scientific imagery, pictograms, ideograms, currencies, seals, stamps and so forth. Due to their affiliation with&nbsp;writing and numbers (therefore deemed less expressive than&nbsp;painting) informational images are marginalized to join graphic design, printing, linguistics, typography, mathematics, archaeology, and are excluded from&nbsp;fine art and art history. Pertinently, this&nbsp;unnoticed imagery constitutes the majority and Elkins compares this&nbsp;to overlooked nonhuman species: “fine art, non-Western art, medieval art, outsider art, and popular imagery might be the familiar mammals and other chordates, and informational imagery, the many other phyla.”<a href="#sdfootnote83sym" name="sdfootnote83anc"><sup>83</sup></a> Rockman celebrates the informational image, such as the map and key, to hybridize “high” art with&nbsp;“low” instrumental imagery. He also privileges the importance, scale, number and variety of nonhumans in his paintings, especially championing “low” species such as ants that&nbsp;gnaw their way through&nbsp;the pictorial vegetation in the <em>Expedition</em> series.</p> <h2>Capture and Traps</h2> <p>Jonathan Crary places the image in crisis due to the atrocities and seismic events witnessed in recent history, which have overridden human powers of imagination. The art critic interprets Rockman’s work as stemming from&nbsp;this predicament and views his paintings as possessing an “after-image” effect.<a href="#sdfootnote84sym" name="sdfootnote84anc"><sup>84</sup></a> This&nbsp;effect defamiliarizes the recognizable through&nbsp;pictorial fiction and image theatrics based on scientific research, placing Rockman’s work somewhere between&nbsp;fantasy and reality, perhaps even a&nbsp;fantastic realism. His work has faced criticism for&nbsp;being illustrative and content-driven<a href="#sdfootnote85sym" name="sdfootnote85anc"><sup>85</sup></a> and reveling in too much technique.<a href="#sdfootnote86sym" name="sdfootnote86anc"><sup>86</sup></a> However, Rockman’s stylistic overtures can lure a&nbsp;viewer, trapping them in seductive surfaces, preventing any easy interpretation or, importantly, a&nbsp;way out. Rockman’s art pivots on capturing attention, forcing us to look at anthropogenic impacts through&nbsp;discomfort.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_fishing-1920x-947.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_fishing-330x-e00.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_fishing-660x-dd2.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_fishing-768x-7ad.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_fishing-1320x-33f.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/22/magdeburg/alexis_rockman_fishing-660x-dd2.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Alexis Rockman, <em>Fishing</em>, 2000.

The slowness of geological and ecological processes are pitched against&nbsp;high-speed digital technology, instantaneity and globalized connectivity, and perhaps hyper-time in these paintings. Nixon avers that&nbsp;human brain circuits are being “reprogrammed” in our fast-paced society and have access to so much they have reached a&nbsp;point of “info-whelm” and “perpetual distraction.”<a href="#sdfootnote94sym" name="sdfootnote94anc"><sup>94</sup></a> Jungles are “wild” habitats that&nbsp;need to be “civilized” by forging a&nbsp;thoroughfare for&nbsp;human access. In <em>Man-Eating Plant</em>, perhaps based on the mythic Laocoön wrestling serpents, the artist is tangled in triffid tentacles, hacking against&nbsp;his own painted creation, conceivably analogous to the predicament of humanity’s complicity within&nbsp;the Anthropocene. The artist and friends are armed with&nbsp;machetes, whilst a&nbsp;local man seems to be seizing the opportunity to shoot the vine-captured artist. Alongside conjuring up sci-fi vegetal revenge movie sets, this&nbsp;painting makes direct ancestral links to human-animal descent through&nbsp;the Chimpanzee (or perhaps an early human ancestor, such as <em>Ardipithecus</em>) at the composition’s edge. The Chimpanzee is a&nbsp;member of the Hominidae family and classified as endangered, threatened by urban residential development, transportation, agriculture, mining, logging, hunting and trapping, and climate change, all Anthropocene symptoms, alongside six other species in this&nbsp;family; the only population not decreasing but&nbsp;increasing is <em>Homo Sapiens</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote95sym" name="sdfootnote95anc"><sup>95</sup></a> Chimpanzees (<em>Pan troglodytes</em>), and other chimp species (Bonobo, <em>Pan paniscus</em>) are non-migratory Old World African-based primates, and here Rockman profiles a&nbsp;great ape in a&nbsp;geography it doesn’t belong to, a&nbsp;deliberate incursion, and she observes her struggling cousins perhaps as a&nbsp;talisman, whilst a&nbsp;photographer shoots, capturing the action. Both these <em>repoussoir</em> peripheral figures act as lead-ins to the painting, at the “threshold” between&nbsp;observer and observed, a&nbsp;device used to sit-in for&nbsp;the viewer.<a href="#sdfootnote96sym" name="sdfootnote96anc"><sup>96</sup></a> This&nbsp;stratagem is repeated in a&nbsp;parallel <em>Expedition</em> painting, <em>Big Game</em>, which chronicles the desire to touristically photograph landscape as an object and fetishized commodity,<a href="#sdfootnote97sym" name="sdfootnote97anc"><sup>97</sup></a> and also portrays again the actions of cutting, as trees are felled. Rockman developed these paintings in his studio from&nbsp;photographs and the shutter’s eye combines with&nbsp;imaginary imagery. As he has stated, “I wanted to re-photograph things that&nbsp;never existed,”<a href="#sdfootnote98sym" name="sdfootnote98anc"><sup>98</sup></a> and strive for&nbsp;“painting the un-photographable, painting time travel.”<a href="#sdfootnote99sym" name="sdfootnote99anc"><sup>99</sup></a> The human form as <em>repoussoir</em> in <em>Big Game</em> is possibly an Arawak tribesman or Carib native Indian and this&nbsp;foreshadowing figure is critical, as “who gets to see, and from&nbsp;where?

The importation of European pastoral and picturesque landscape conventions onto&nbsp;representations of conquered land, and depictions of the cultural ‘Other’ such as those exampled by W.J.T.

For&nbsp;Mitchell, landscape is a&nbsp;“medium of exchange, between&nbsp;the human and the natural, the self and the other”<a href="#sdfootnote114sym" name="sdfootnote114anc"><sup>114</sup></a> and since&nbsp;the human is natural, even more so in the Anthropocene (although Mitchell still differentiates the two), landscape becomes a&nbsp;“<em>natural</em> representation of a&nbsp;natural scene,” an “icon of nature <em>in</em> nature itself, as if nature were imprinting and encoding its essential structures on our perceptual apparatus.” Mitchell casts this&nbsp;as “Nature representing itself to itself,” through&nbsp;reflections in water for&nbsp;instance<a href="#sdfootnote115sym" name="sdfootnote115anc"><sup>115</sup></a> and the reflection of Rockman’s mirror-image through&nbsp;self-portraiture, reflects back on the viewer, most likely a&nbsp;Western consumer of art.</p> <p>In an interview with&nbsp;the artist, Corbett introduces Rockman as a&nbsp;“painter of eco-dystopias, no-man’s lands.”<a href="#sdfootnote116sym" name="sdfootnote116anc"><sup>116</sup></a> No-man’s land is as apt description in relation to land ownership in the Anthropocene –&nbsp;who does the polluted land belong to and who is responsible?

The human figure is reversed from&nbsp;active predator to prostrate prey as gargantuan mosquitoes hover over&nbsp;the prone human body, presumably the unaware artist (repeated throughout the <em>Expedition</em> series) and revealed through&nbsp;two feet exposing tempting flesh to the bloodsucking gnats, with&nbsp;proboscises ready to pierce his skin. The dramatic chiaroscuro in this&nbsp;nocturne uses a&nbsp;lamp-light technique similar to that&nbsp;perfected by 18th-century British painter Joseph Wright of Derby. Alongside this&nbsp;visual similarity and Rockman’s inspiration perhaps from&nbsp;1995 cult horror science-fiction film <em>Mosquito</em>, the formal composition of <em>The Hammock</em> recalls Giotto’s 14th-century fresco <em>The Lamentation of Christ</em><a href="#sdfootnote118sym" name="sdfootnote118anc"><sup>118</sup></a> in the Scrovegni (Arena) Chapel in Padua, Italy.

Through&nbsp;Rockman’s demotion in scale and shrinkage in importance of the human concealed in the hammock, <em>Anthropos</em> becomes diminutive in a&nbsp;mortal world. The human for&nbsp;Rockman is vital to nonhumans as sustenance and cohabiters, where it becomes necessary to put down&nbsp;guns and weapons of capture in order to fully understand how humans are entangled in the Earth system. Therefore, the use of drama, visionary devices, the human figure, imagination and humor in painting, might challenge the inadequate justifications of the Trump regime on climate change and the continuing colonization of all forms of nature.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div>
