				<section class="u-typo">   <blockquote> <p>To imagine a&nbsp;world of matter is to space and place materials, it is necessarily a<em> geopolitical </em>act.</p> <p></p> <p style="text-align: right;">Gavin Bridge, World of Matter<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></p> </blockquote> <p><br><br>“We are no longer able to think history as exclusively human,” Timothy Morton claims, “for the very reason that&nbsp;we are in the Anthropocene.”<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a> Coined in natural sciences, the ‘Anthropocene’ (the age of humans) is the name scientists Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer gave to describe a&nbsp;new geological era in which human activity is considered so profound that&nbsp;it surpasses other geological forces on the planet, and which will leave a&nbsp;long-term signature in the strata record.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a> “Geologically, this&nbsp;is a&nbsp;remarkable episode in the history of the planet,”<a href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a> Crutzen et. al aver. About&nbsp;30-50 percent of the planet’s surface is exploited by mankind<a href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a>: vast expanses of land and ocean have been drilled for&nbsp;oil, mountains have been scoured for&nbsp;coal, rainforests have been razed and the oceans are infested with&nbsp;billions of particles of microplastics.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a> “We have become titanic geological agents, our legacy legible for&nbsp;millenia to come.”<a href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a></p> <p>Recognizing the Anthropocene allow us to understand the ecological crisis of the present day in the context of the distant past&nbsp;and points to the urgency of developing a&nbsp;new understanding of nature itself and the attitude humans should adopt towards&nbsp;it.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a> Whereas corporate media and the entertainment industry present never-ending apocalyptic scenarios where environmental catastrophe is our unavoidable fate,<a href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a> artistic production and discourse has by contrast become more engaged in attempts to find alternative ethical ways to rebalance our relationship with&nbsp;nature. Unlike&nbsp;Land Art of the 1960s and 1970s, which took natural landscapes as both means and sites for&nbsp;artistic production, this&nbsp;new wave of eco-aesthetics aims to bring to the foreground the complex ‘ecologies’ –&nbsp;social, economic, political, discursive, and Earth systems –&nbsp;of global forces which contributed to the transition to the current geological era. The extent of to which the current system has degraded both natural and societal ecosystems is investigated through&nbsp;compelling analyses and creative alternatives for&nbsp;other “forms of environmental sustainability and egalitarian structures of living” are put forth.<a href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a> These innovative artistic approaches reflect upon&nbsp;how we might comprehend the present interchange of human culture and the environment and probe the socio-political and “ecological realities surrounding us as well as those yet to come.”<a href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a></p> <p>A growing number of artists, political theorists, scientists, intellectuals and activists are currently trying to think outside&nbsp;the enforced narratives of neoliberal capitalism, both within&nbsp;the institutionalized exhibition spaces of the contemporary art system and beyond&nbsp;those platforms, where the creation of social relations and the reclamation of zones of autonomy and the commons can be obtained.<a href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a> They are committed to investigating the actions of states and corporations and also to reflect critically on the terms in which contemporary political practices are currently undertaken. As these forms of materiality are emerging, however, it is paramount that&nbsp;the existing disciplinary division between&nbsp;science and the humanities is bridged to generate constructive debate over&nbsp;the solutions required to overcome the current ecological disaster. Thus, the question remains: how does the environmental crisis –&nbsp;the Anthropocene –&nbsp;enter the discourse of art and what forms of representation does it take?</p> <p>Consider the case of World of Matter<em>, </em>an international media, art and research collective that&nbsp;investigates the relations between&nbsp;social, political, environmental and economic spheres as a&nbsp;form of artistic practice. Launched in 2013 as a&nbsp;multimedia platform with&nbsp;an open-access archive, it connects different files, actors, territories and ideas on the global ecologies of resources, exploitation and circulation,<a href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a> World of Matter focuses on the development of innovative aesthetic and equitable ethical approaches to the world’s resources. By combining environmental humanities and methodical research with&nbsp;ecological and social justice activism,<a href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a> the practice of World of Matter calls for&nbsp;a&nbsp;reconsideration –&nbsp;at a&nbsp;fundamental level –&nbsp;of how we understand and interact with&nbsp;the world of ‘things.’<a href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a> The collective conveys this&nbsp;practice through&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of videos, photographs, cartographic analyses and mixed-media installations all publicly available on their website, but&nbsp;also globally exhibited in different institutional spaces.<a href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a> This&nbsp;paper argues that&nbsp;World of Matter embodies an alternative approach to the understanding of the environmental crisis, a&nbsp;democratization of the discourse on the Anthropocene, and brings innovative forms of social aesthetics to the foreground.</p> <h2>The Anthropocene’s universalising discourse and its critique</h2> <p>In their groundbreaking article simply titled <em>The Anthropocene</em> (2000), authors Crutzen and Stoermer depend on the concept of the ‘noösphere’ to articulate their position. They describe the ‘noösphere’ as “the world of thought, to mark the growing role played by mankind’s brain-power and technological talents in shaping its own future and environment.”<a href="#sdfootnote17sym" name="sdfootnote17anc"><sup>17</sup></a> Drawing on this&nbsp;concept, which places thought above&nbsp;the biosphere and geosphere, the authors reflect on the progression of human influence upon&nbsp;the planet. Crutzen and Stoermer suggest the following&nbsp;thoughts on the collective work in order to address the current geological epoch:</p> <blockquote> <p>To develop a&nbsp;world-wide accepted strategy leading to sustainability of ecosystems against&nbsp;human induced stresses will be one of the great future tasks of mankind, requiring intensive research efforts and wise application of the knowledge thus acquired in the noösphere, better known as knowledge or information society. An exciting, but&nbsp;also difficult and daunting task lies ahead of the global research and engineering community to guide mankind towards&nbsp;global, sustainable, environmental management.<a href="#sdfootnote18sym" name="sdfootnote18anc"><sup>18</sup></a></p> </blockquote> <p>Crutzen and Stoermer’s argument not only demonstrates the achievements and impacts of human mastery of the Earth but&nbsp;also pitches geoengineering<a href="#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc"><sup>19</sup></a> as our only remaining hope in adapting to inevitable climate transformation –&nbsp;a&nbsp;position which is challenged by activists who advocate for&nbsp;a&nbsp;“system changed, not climate change.”<a href="#sdfootnote20sym" name="sdfootnote20anc"><sup>20</sup></a></p> <p>By now there is an extensive introductory literature on the Anthropocene, and the concept has become part of a&nbsp;growing discourse in the arts, humanities and social sciences.<a href="#sdfootnote21sym" name="sdfootnote21anc"><sup>21</sup></a> There is an ongoing discussion involving the concept and its contradictions. As many scholars, particularly in the humanities, have pointed out that&nbsp;the concept of the Anthropocene carries certain universalizing characteristics and thus, fails to adequately account for&nbsp;structural power relations.<a href="#sdfootnote22sym" name="sdfootnote22anc"><sup>22</sup></a> Indeed, there is a&nbsp;fundamental contradiction in the Anthropocene thought-structure. The prefix ‘anthropos,’<a href="#sdfootnote23sym" name="sdfootnote23anc"><sup>23</sup></a> denotes that&nbsp;<em>all </em>humans are equally implicated in the ‘activities’ that&nbsp;are allegedly responsible for&nbsp;this new geological era. However, the ‘activities’ that&nbsp;are shown in the Anthropocene visualisations –&nbsp;which seldom focus on environmental emergencies and scenes of ‘slow violence’<a href="#sdfootnote24sym" name="sdfootnote24anc"><sup>24</sup></a>– are hardly ‘human,’ in the generalizing sense of the word, and are in fact mostly the actions of corporate industry. The fact is that&nbsp;the Anthropocene –&nbsp;as a&nbsp;rhetorical formation with&nbsp;legal, political, cultural and geological strands –&nbsp;frequently functions as a&nbsp;universalizing discourse<a href="#sdfootnote25sym" name="sdfootnote25anc"><sup>25</sup></a> that&nbsp;tends to disavow different responsibility for&nbsp;the geological changes it designates; and instead, it homogeneously delegates agency to the generic participants in its human activities. Narratives such as these serve to divert attention from&nbsp;the economic class that&nbsp;has long benefited from&nbsp;the financial system responsible for&nbsp;environmental change. Heather Davis and Etienne Turpin explain that&nbsp;the Anthropocene is not simply the result of activities “undertaken by the species <em>Homo sapiens</em>,” but&nbsp;instead, it derives from&nbsp;“a particular nexus of epistemic, technological, social and political economic coalescences” formed in the contemporary reality of “petrocapitalism.”<a href="#sdfootnote26sym" name="sdfootnote26anc"><sup>26</sup></a></p> <p>As above, the Anthropocene rhetoric simply “fails to capture the divisions and antagonism at play,”<a href="#sdfootnote27sym" name="sdfootnote27anc"><sup>27</sup></a> focusing on its universal discourse where ‘we’ have caused this, leaving intact the corporate colonial network underlying the human activity. As Naomi Klein notes, the Anthropocene rhetoric carries an “unspoken meaning: the humans are a&nbsp;single type, that&nbsp;human nature can be essentialized to the traits that&nbsp;created this&nbsp;crisis,” and that, as a&nbsp;result of this&nbsp;choice, “the systems that&nbsp;certain humans created, and other humans powerfully resisted, are completely off&nbsp;the hook. Capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy –&nbsp;those sorts of systems.”<a href="#sdfootnote28sym" name="sdfootnote28anc"><sup>28</sup></a> We are stuck in a&nbsp;current global inertia over&nbsp;climate change because “the actions that&nbsp;would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe –&nbsp;and would benefit the vast majority –&nbsp;are extremely threatening to an elite minority that&nbsp;has a&nbsp;stranglehold over&nbsp;our economy, our political process, and most of our major media outlets.”<a href="#sdfootnote29sym" name="sdfootnote29anc"><sup>29</sup></a> The danger, thus, is that&nbsp;the Anthropocene is read as the thesis that&nbsp;such an era exists, rather than&nbsp;widening the questions on how to respond to it. In this&nbsp;regard, Heather Davis and Zoe Todd question –&nbsp;if the Anthropocene is already here –&nbsp;then “what can we do with&nbsp;it as a&nbsp;conceptual apparatus that&nbsp;may serve to undermine the conditions that&nbsp;it names?”<a href="#sdfootnote30sym" name="sdfootnote30anc"><sup>30</sup></a></p> <p>We have to understand that&nbsp;the Anthropocene is essentially a&nbsp;political crisis. There are plenty of solutions for&nbsp;sustainable living today, which, if implemented globally, could protect biodiversity and bring about&nbsp;a&nbsp;more equitable and inclusive socioeconomic order.<a href="#sdfootnote31sym" name="sdfootnote31anc"><sup>31</sup></a> A&nbsp;series of scientists, environmental and political activists argue that&nbsp;to deal with&nbsp;the threat of climate change, a&nbsp;systemic shift in the reorganization of social, political and economic life –&nbsp;the ‘Great Transition’<a href="#sdfootnote32sym" name="sdfootnote32anc"><sup>32</sup></a>– is required. But&nbsp;of course, this&nbsp;would imply humbling the current environmentally destructive corporate-state oligarchy. As TJ Demos explains,</p> <blockquote> <p>we cannot address climate justice adequately without&nbsp;also targeting the corruption of democratic practice by corporate lobbying, or the underfunding and failure of public transportation systems, or indigenous rights violations by industrial extractivism, or police violence and the militarization of borders. For&nbsp;these areas all link up in one way or another as interconnected strands of political ecology.<a href="#sdfootnote33sym" name="sdfootnote33anc"><sup>33</sup></a></p> </blockquote> <p>In a&nbsp;similar vein, historian Dipesh Chakrabarty claims that&nbsp;“a critique that&nbsp;is only a&nbsp;critique of capital is not sufficient for&nbsp;addressing questions relating to human history once the crisis of climate change has been acknowledged and the Anthropocene has begun to loom on the horizon of our present. The geologic now of the Anthropocene has become entangled with&nbsp;the now of human history.”<a href="#sdfootnote34sym" name="sdfootnote34anc"><sup>34</sup></a> Factually, human-kind has treated nature as something to use, exploit, commercialize and colonize. Three centuries have passed since&nbsp;the birth of the Cartesian concept of ‘mastery of nature’ –&nbsp;so indispensable in the technological crisis of this&nbsp;century –&nbsp;and yet, our attitude of human-centered exceptionalism seems to have got worse. Despite&nbsp;the growing waves of social and political realignment and support for&nbsp;a&nbsp;shift towards&nbsp;ecological perspectives, it is clear to see that&nbsp;the colonization of nature continues today apace.</p> <p>For this&nbsp;reason, rather than&nbsp;using the obfuscatory term “Anthropocene”, some scholars, such as Jason Moore, Andreas Malm and Donna Haraway, are opting for&nbsp;a&nbsp;strategy of ‘calling violence by its name,’ and instead refer to the new geological epoch as the Capitolocene (the age of capitalism) –&nbsp;the historical era shaped by the endless capital accumulation.<a href="#sdfootnote35sym" name="sdfootnote35anc"><sup>35</sup></a> Such terminological distinction locates the source of climate change not in the existence of our species, but&nbsp;within intricate and interconnected processes caused by the organization of modern capitalism on a&nbsp;global scale. It foregrounds how “capitalism evolved within&nbsp;and against&nbsp;nature’s web of life” and attributes the environmental crisis to “complex socio-economic, political, and material operations involving classes and commodities, imperialisms and empires, and biotechnology and militarism.”<a href="#sdfootnote36sym" name="sdfootnote36anc"><sup>36</sup></a> It is important to understand that&nbsp;the terminological choice is not simply a&nbsp;matter of semantics, but&nbsp;rather of historical accuracy and truth. The Anthropocene is about&nbsp;the destruction of places and times of refuge for&nbsp;people and other species, it marks severe discontinuities.<a href="#sdfootnote37sym" name="sdfootnote37anc"><sup>37</sup></a> Thus, we need other names to account for&nbsp;the complexity and multiple dimensionality of this&nbsp;geo-politic and economic formation.<a href="#sdfootnote38sym" name="sdfootnote38anc"><sup>38</sup></a> Whatever term one chooses to adopt, the fact is that&nbsp;the issue with&nbsp;the Anthropocene cannot be addressed adequately without&nbsp;confronting “the corporate control of life,”<a href="#sdfootnote39sym" name="sdfootnote39anc"><sup>39</sup></a> as activist Vandana Shiva claims.</p> <h2>Investigating material geographies</h2> <p>Born out of research into&nbsp;the deep imbrications of the social, technological, knowledge, artistic and natural spheres, the collaborative art project World of Matter involves visual practitioners, ecological researchers, social justice activists, and environmental-humanities scholars conducting long-term research on ‘material geographies.’<a href="#sdfootnote40sym" name="sdfootnote40anc"><sup>40</sup></a> Specialists are brought together to draw on different methodologies that&nbsp;“scrutinize zones of geopolitical-ecological upheaval.”<a href="#sdfootnote41sym" name="sdfootnote41anc"><sup>41</sup></a> The results are translated into&nbsp;audio-visual media, mixed-media installations, texts and cartographies, which they deem a&nbsp;“valuable instrument for&nbsp;education, activist work, research and general raising of public awareness”<a href="#sdfootnote42sym" name="sdfootnote42anc"><sup>42</sup></a> to destabilize the <em>status quo</em>. The collective’s approach is critically experimental, which involves ethnographic methodologies, field research and self-reflexive knowledge production. According to Peter Mörtenböck and Helge Mooshammer, World of Matter<em> </em>was created as a&nbsp;response to “…a more ecological world-view through&nbsp;a&nbsp;collection of visual material on resource matters, arguing that&nbsp;any discursive shift necessitates and depends upon&nbsp;a&nbsp;different perspective on human-earth relations.”<a href="#sdfootnote43sym" name="sdfootnote43anc"><sup>43</sup></a> In other words, World of Matter’s perspective calls for&nbsp;a&nbsp;reconsideration of how we understand and interact with&nbsp;the world of things. Their aim is to present a&nbsp;new mode of thinking which engages with&nbsp;a&nbsp;new imaginary of the world. The collective asks: “How to engage when humans and nonhumans are equal actants in a&nbsp;shared world? What forms of action take into&nbsp;account the fact that&nbsp;our knowledge of the world has limits?”<a href="#sdfootnote44sym" name="sdfootnote44anc"><sup>44</sup></a> “How can we then conceive of an alternative engagement with&nbsp;the realities of the earth that&nbsp;recognises the entanglement of human life without&nbsp;reclaiming further privileges of superiority?”<a href="#sdfootnote45sym" name="sdfootnote45anc"><sup>45</sup></a></p> <p>World of Matter’s main strategy and concern is to suggest and make visible the connections among&nbsp;different sites, materials, processes, attitudes, and agencies, that&nbsp;is, “…between the ways in which human and nonhuman tangible and less tangible things in the world matter.”<a href="#sdfootnote46sym" name="sdfootnote46anc"><sup>46</sup></a> They explain:</p> <blockquote> <p>Humans have exhausted virtually all known resource deposits on the planet […]. Large-scale mining is penetrating ever deeper layers, multinational land grabs are advancing to remote corners and the race is on for&nbsp;the neo-colonial division of the seabed. […] With&nbsp;growing consciousness about&nbsp;global environmental limits, there is urgent need for&nbsp;new discourses and modes of representation that&nbsp;shift resource-related debates from&nbsp;a&nbsp;market-driven domain to open platforms for&nbsp;engaged and decentralized public discourse.<a href="#sdfootnote47sym" name="sdfootnote47anc"><sup>47</sup></a></p> </blockquote> <p>Conceived in this&nbsp;way, World of Matter produces research that&nbsp;finds new approaches to finite resources and explores proposals for&nbsp;creative sustainable alternatives.<a href="#sdfootnote48sym" name="sdfootnote48anc"><sup>48</sup></a> The collective is comprised of core members Mabe Bethônico, Ursula Biemann, Uwe H.

For&nbsp;Nixon, slow violence is that&nbsp;which occurs gradually and out of sight, “a violence of delayed destruction that&nbsp;is dispersed across&nbsp;time and space, and attritional violence that&nbsp;is typically not viewed as violence at all.”<a href="#sdfootnote57sym" name="sdfootnote57anc"><sup>57</sup></a> Through&nbsp;a&nbsp;proliferation of films, text-based displays, photo-essays, cartographic analyses, sculptural and mixed-media installations, World of Matter has sought to ‘make visible’ the slow and devastating force of capitalist globalization.<a href="#sdfootnote58sym" name="sdfootnote58anc"><sup>58</sup></a> Their cartographies link to concrete sites, materialities and histories of globally dispersed places that&nbsp;have seen dramatic transformations of their landscapes [Fig. 1].

This&nbsp;is clearly seen in her annotated footage where the artist presents a&nbsp;newfound attentiveness to matter and its power. In her words, “[n]ot everything comes into&nbsp;being through&nbsp;human intention, and we need to examine the ways in which human and nonhuman realities emerge together in a&nbsp;variety of formations.”<a href="#sdfootnote92sym" name="sdfootnote92anc"><sup>92</sup></a> <em>Egyptian Chemistry</em> outlines a&nbsp;network of relations comprising water politics, hydroelectric schemes, fish ecologies, nitrate industries, geoengineering, use of land and socio-political revolution (the Arab Spring) –&nbsp;each affected by neoliberal policy.

Unlike&nbsp;many eco-artistic projects, World of Matter does not present nature as an object to be instrumentalized or financially speculated upon. Rather, the collective’s approach sees human agency as one of many partners generating a&nbsp;given situation and outlines a&nbsp;network of relations. By distributing agency beyond&nbsp;strictly conceived anthropocentric causality, World of Matter’s projects manage to convey the complexity of geopolitics, how human systems bear an unintentional agency upon&nbsp;nature. The group members claim, “[o]ur intention is not to create more facts, or to debunk existing assumptions,” but&nbsp;rather “to offer an arena in which to assemble and, in the words of Latour, ‘care’.”<a href="#sdfootnote94sym" name="sdfootnote94anc"><sup>94</sup></a> World of Matter evidences a&nbsp;collective commitment to investigate and make visible industrial modernity’s colonization, which extends beyond&nbsp;human agents alone.</p> <p>Whilst each artwork has its own individual aesthetic and methodology, they still share a&nbsp;common set of principles. Most notable are the multiple methodologies including ethnography, field research and experimental documentary video, combining interviews with&nbsp;diverse subjects, socio-political analysis and historical investigation –&nbsp;often presented with&nbsp;explanatory titles, or as a&nbsp;voice-over –&nbsp;alongside environmental footage and philosophical speculative thinking presented through&nbsp;annotated film.<a href="#sdfootnote95sym" name="sdfootnote95anc"><sup>95</sup></a> These are crucial components in their proposal which seeks a&nbsp;reconsideration of the relationship between&nbsp;material and discourse, and to create a&nbsp;more democratic and critical debate on the environmental crisis, the Anthropocene. World of Matter presents itself not as “fully integrated single narrative, but&nbsp;as distinct and recombinable files, fragmentary testimonies,”<a href="#sdfootnote96sym" name="sdfootnote96anc"><sup>96</sup></a> and photographic archives still in progress. As Brian Holmes puts it, “its strength [is] to let the world <em>break down&nbsp;</em>into real complexity, so that&nbsp;‘the crackling noise of the forming and breaking of molecular bonds can be heard at all times’.”<a href="#sdfootnote97sym" name="sdfootnote97anc"><sup>97</sup></a></p> <p>It is interesting to see how the collective presents footage of the corporate exploitation of natural resources and people by bridging the specialist division and probing the political significance of environmental developments. Yet, World of Matter refuses to fall into&nbsp;the trap of the Anthropocene discourse of proposing solutions to climate change that&nbsp;endorse the neoliberal market. Moving beyond&nbsp;the visualization of economic and environmental dynamics, World of Matter’s practice reiterates that, as Demos emphasizes, “it is imperative to invent a&nbsp;new and different ‘ecological capital’ that&nbsp;would definancialize nature,” which correlates “a new ecological understanding with&nbsp;a&nbsp;new political economy –&nbsp;a&nbsp;political ecology that&nbsp;posits the environment’s sustainability as a&nbsp;source of intrinsic value.”<a href="#sdfootnote98sym" name="sdfootnote98anc"><sup>98</sup></a> In other words, by presenting a&nbsp;critical engagement with&nbsp;the concrete set of policies and attitudes carried by corporate capitalism, World of Matter strives towards&nbsp;a&nbsp;more inclusive multispecies understanding and use of natural resources. Exploring new ways to conceptualize and materialize an inclusive field of collectivisation, a&nbsp;new “cooperative of things,”<a href="#sdfootnote99sym" name="sdfootnote99anc"><sup>99</sup></a> the collective’s practice surpasses the assumptions of anthropocentrism and fosters the already existing forms of human–nonhuman <em>commons</em><a href="#sdfootnote100sym" name="sdfootnote100anc"><sup>100</sup></a>.</p> <p>In his article <em>After Nature </em>(1999)<em>, </em>Arturo Escobar defines political ecology as “the study of the manifold articulations of history and biology and the cultural mediations through&nbsp;which such articulations are necessarily established.”<a href="#sdfootnote101sym" name="sdfootnote101anc"><sup>101</sup></a> World of Matter’s globalized research methodology represents an expanded platform with&nbsp;which it addresses a&nbsp;fundamental element of political ecology. In tracing the specific local articulations of globalizing dynamics, the collective exposes the way in which globalization functions as a&nbsp;scale-making activity, as an apparatus which can farm, harvest, circulate raw materials, and mines ores in disparate countries.<a href="#sdfootnote102sym" name="sdfootnote102anc"><sup>102</sup></a> The results are materialized in critical and aesthetic strategies to render the intricate ecologies of the contemporary world, in an effort to imagine the globe differently, as a&nbsp;place of commonality for&nbsp;ecological imaginaries. Avoiding the reduction of nature to inert matter, World of Matter proposes a&nbsp;recalibration of the entanglements between&nbsp;human and nonhuman materials, to accept the mingling and bring to the foreground an ecological thinking where human and nonhuman matter are equal actants.<a href="#sdfootnote103sym" name="sdfootnote103anc"><sup>103</sup></a> In Mörtenböck and Mooshammer’s words, “[t]he point here is to expand the imaginary of possibilities” and start thinking about&nbsp;the ‘cooperative of things,’<a href="#sdfootnote104sym" name="sdfootnote104anc"><sup>104</sup></a> not to discriminate between&nbsp;the ecologies of things and the manifold human relations that&nbsp;develop around&nbsp;them. It is about&nbsp;recognizing what Escobar deems the “plurality of natures”<a href="#sdfootnote105sym" name="sdfootnote105anc"><sup>105</sup></a>– capitalist and noncapitalist, modern and unmodern –&nbsp;in which both the social and the biological have central, yet not essential, roles to play.</p> <h2>Radical imaginaries and the responsibility of art</h2> <p>In 2013 Professor Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for&nbsp;Climate Change Research claimed, “silence is an advocacy for&nbsp;the status quo.”<a href="#sdfootnote106sym" name="sdfootnote106anc"><sup>106</sup></a> Scientists who think of themselves as the least engaged, are inadvertently among&nbsp;the most political. This&nbsp;is equally true in the cultural realm. For&nbsp;this reason, art has a&nbsp;crucial role in the age of the Anthropocene. Art allows us to see the world through&nbsp;a&nbsp;different lens, providing an alternative perspective. Through&nbsp;critical thinking, creative methodology and a&nbsp;willingness to do away with&nbsp;the status quo, art has the potential to shift the paradigm and break with&nbsp;traditional narratives. It provokes self-reflection by bringing to the fore our most unpleasant and destructive human tendencies and for&nbsp;this reason, art has a&nbsp;crucial role in the age of the Anthropocene. Demos argues that&nbsp;“to cling to some outdated notion of artistic autonomy […] divorced from&nbsp;any duty or responsibility for&nbsp;environmental considerations, is to advocate, intentionally or not, for&nbsp;the status quo of neoliberal exceptionalism and its destructive ecocide.”<a href="#sdfootnote107sym" name="sdfootnote107anc"><sup>107</sup></a> This&nbsp;latter statement seems to be a&nbsp;blunt accusation. However, if we acknowledge that&nbsp;the present unsustainable system of governance cannot continue, then we must also understand that&nbsp;art has an imperative responsibility.</p> <p>Recent engagement has galvanised the energy of anti-Anthropocene activism that&nbsp;refuse to generalize and depoliticize climate change agency, and to reject current corporate-dominated environmental governance. These global movements promote alternative forms of living that&nbsp;go beyond&nbsp;the Anthropocene’s geoengineering ambitions, which prefer to address only the consequences, rather than&nbsp;interrogate the systematic processes of centuries of capitalism and colonial relations towards&nbsp;nature. Chantal Mouffe has pointed out that, “[t]he building of a&nbsp;new hegemony implies the creation of a&nbsp;‘chain of equivalence’ among&nbsp;the diversity of democratic struggles, old and new, in order to form a&nbsp;‘collective will’, a&nbsp;‘we’ of the radical democratic forces.”<a href="#sdfootnote108sym" name="sdfootnote108anc"><sup>108</sup></a> To deal with&nbsp;the current ecological crisis, an intersectional approach that&nbsp;insists on seeing the inextricable relations of power, economic forces and ideological mechanisms, is needed. Different scales of engagements are already connecting diverse disciplines, institutions, and communities, “all working together toward&nbsp;changing the paradigm,”<a href="#sdfootnote109sym" name="sdfootnote109anc"><sup>109</sup></a> moving toward&nbsp;environmental responsibility, economic equality and social justice.</p> <p>World of Matter’s international scope help its members to conceive global modes of social organization, linking social movements, network activism and communities in the search of alternative “resource ecologies.”<a href="#sdfootnote110sym" name="sdfootnote110anc"><sup>110</sup></a> By offering a&nbsp;platform for&nbsp;the individuals to develop critical thought regarding&nbsp;socio-political and ecological issues, World of Matter intends to contribute to a&nbsp;free production of shared knowledge that&nbsp;remains open, collective, and widely accessible, pitched against&nbsp;colonial corporate-governmental surveillance and proprietary control of the internet.<a href="#sdfootnote111sym" name="sdfootnote111anc"><sup>111</sup></a> But, exactly how inclusive, accessible and comprehensible are these informative aesthetic projects? How easy is it, for&nbsp;the non-academic or art scholar public, to stumble upon&nbsp;World of Matter’s projects whether it is through&nbsp;the internet, a&nbsp;debate, a&nbsp;presentation or exhibition? Ultimately, this&nbsp;is where the collective’s modus operandi stumbles, as the project is usually presented within&nbsp;an institutional structure and the artworks are surrounded by a&nbsp;complex theoretical framework that&nbsp;is sometimes difficult to follow. It would, thus, be interesting to see how many of the users visiting World of Matter’s website come from&nbsp;a&nbsp;scholarly background.<a href="#sdfootnote112sym" name="sdfootnote112anc"><sup>112</sup></a></p> <p>According to Cornelius Castoriadis, radical imaginary is “the capacity to posit that&nbsp;which is not, to see in something that&nbsp;which is not there.”<a href="#sdfootnote113sym" name="sdfootnote113anc"><sup>113</sup></a> The question is not whether this&nbsp;is done, but&nbsp;rather how do we see the world and what do we invent? In this&nbsp;regard, art has the advantage of being able to work as a&nbsp;laboratory where experimental formulations can conceive new collectivities that&nbsp;might contribute to widening social and ecological transformations. “It’s high time to make a&nbsp;break with&nbsp;our own normalized ways of creating and propagating world-pictures,” Holmes claims. “Don’t imagine the apocalypse, that’s old hat. Just bring your radical imagination to focus on the end of global capitalism.”<a href="#sdfootnote114sym" name="sdfootnote114anc"><sup>114</sup></a> This&nbsp;is precisely what World of Matter tries to do. In undoing and rearticulating the relationship with&nbsp;the shared world, the collective’s practice bears witness to a&nbsp;different kind of materialism, a&nbsp;non-anthropocentric materialism that&nbsp;fosters a&nbsp;blueprint for&nbsp;other forms of collaboration between&nbsp;human and nonhuman actants. The project presents thought-provoking insight into&nbsp;the way natural resources are considered and handled, and provides innovative aesthetic and ethical considerations that&nbsp;challenge the accepted status quo that&nbsp;matter is mainly for&nbsp;human consumption. Rather than&nbsp;presenting alternative worlds and solutions that&nbsp;would save&nbsp;‘us’ from&nbsp;the catastrophic future that&nbsp;is in store for&nbsp;us, World of Matter practices the ideas of knowledge as a&nbsp;sustainable resource, forging ‘ecological’ modes of knowledge-making and pointing towards&nbsp;the vital connection between&nbsp;human and nonhuman <em>commons </em>as a&nbsp;shared good. Yet, its practice remains problem-addressing, rather than&nbsp;problem-solving, as the collective does not provide tangible solutions to the dominant models of world–building.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div>

<p><a href="#sdfootnote25anc" name="sdfootnote25sym">25</a>The Anthropocene’s universalizing logic has a history. Many scholars seem to agree that this account can be traced back to 1972, when the Apollo 17 crew took the first photograph of the Earth from space: <em>Blue Marble</em>. “This photograph”, decolonial theorist Rolando Vazquez observes, “accomplishes the renaissance geographers’ dream of reducing earth to an object of representation; it is a moment in which the anthropocentric gaze achieves, as it were, its historical completion, the absurdity of its totality”. The Earth as a unified object, thus, was turned into an object of representation, and incorporated into the Cartesian subject-object division. This separation of humans from the rest of nature suddenly appeared as a self-evident definitive reality. Rolando Vazquez, ‘Precedence, Earth and the Anthropocene: Decolonizing Design’, <em>Design Philosophy Papers</em> 15, no. 1 (2 January 2017): 80. <em>Blue Marble,</em> however,<em> </em>also answered calls for a unifying “world perspective” that could bring “earthlings” together visually, and thus, socio-politically, as voiced by Stewart Brand. Reported in an interview with Steward Brand conducted by Joseph Corn (Buckminster Fuller Lectures, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, February 27, 2002) ‘Hohlwelt - Interactive Environments - Context/Examples - Stewart Brand’, <span>accessed 13 November 2017, </span><a href="http://www.hohlwelt.com/en/interact/context/sbrand.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.hohlwelt.com/en/interact/context/sbrand.html</a>. This universalising logic goes hand in hand with tactics embedded in a colonial modernist’s rhetoric –the main subject of decolonial critique. For more see Walter D. Mignolo, <em>The Darker Side of Western Modernity: Global Futures, Decolonial Options</em>, 1 edition (Durham: Duke University Press Books, 2011); Vazquez, ‘Precedence, Earth and the Anthropocene’; Walter D.

World-making projects emerged from practical activities of making lives; in the process these endeavours alter our planet. To see them, in the shadow of the Anthropocene’s ‘anthropo-’, we must reorient our attention. Many preindustrial livelihoods, from foraging to stealing, persist today, and new ones […] emerge, but we neglect them because they are not a part of [modernity’s notion of] progress”.

The artists explain that “<em>LandRush </em>grows organically chapter by chapter in a constant cycle of research, production and presentation. Each chapter is a complete story for the moment, but can be revisited once situations change. So, by its very design <em>LandRush</em> is and stays in a constant Beta. This open process allows our work to surface in ever-new contexts, gradually building a bridge between magazine journalism, web documentaries, interactive apps and spatial installations, where the storytelling transfers from the context of journalism into the space of art”. In the website section <em>LandRush iPad-App </em>the user can see that three subthemes have been created (<em>The Farm, The Road </em>and<em> Family Affairs</em>)<em> </em>and three upcoming subthemes (<em>Dry West–California Drought, Full Circle </em>and<em> Dry West–American Nile</em>).
