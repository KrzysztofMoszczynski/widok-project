				<section class="u-typo">   <blockquote> <p style="text-align: right;">Now, political films are no longer shown in factories.</p> <p style="text-align: right;">They are shown in the museum, or the gallery –&nbsp;the art space.</p> <p style="text-align: right;">Hito Steyerl, “Is a&nbsp;Museum a&nbsp;Factory?”<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></p> </blockquote> <p></p> <p>Cinematography occupies an ambiguous position within&nbsp;the field of cultural production, which stems both from&nbsp;its origins and its contemporary use. The emergence of the moving image is strictly connected to technological advancement within&nbsp;the capitalist system of production: it arose from&nbsp;factory halls, from&nbsp;market-driven advances in the process of the extraction of surplus value. Simultaneously, the wide dissemination of the medium announced a&nbsp;new iteration of the extractive economy, which turned towards&nbsp;attention and affects.<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a> The mass of viewers, assembled predominantly from&nbsp;the working classes, became for&nbsp;the cinema –&nbsp;as it was for&nbsp;industry –&nbsp;an essential producer of value.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a> Therefore, it should come as no surprise that&nbsp;one of the first commercial screenings of the Lumière brothers, taking place on 28 December 1895 in the Grand Café on Boulevard des Capucines in Paris, featured the moving picture titled <em>Workers </em><em>Leaving the Lumière Factory</em>.<a href="#sdfootnote4sym" name="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a> This&nbsp;anecdotal moment of cinema’s beginnings can be used as an entry point for&nbsp;an inquiry about&nbsp;the representation of labor on the cinematic screen. Such an inquiry, as we shall see, has to address not only cinema itself, but&nbsp;move towards&nbsp;answering broader questions arising from&nbsp;the conditions of the visibility of work in subsequent stages of capital’s development.</p> <p>The social history of art is a&nbsp;historiographic method originating in the work of György Lukács and developed by Arnold Hauser in the early post-war period. One of the crucial insights provided by this&nbsp;contested branch of knowledge<a href="#sdfootnote5sym" name="sdfootnote5anc"><sup>5</sup></a> is the critique of autonomy in the field of art. In the context of modernity, following&nbsp;the work of Walter Benjamin and Jürgen Habermas, the social history of art suggested that&nbsp;the experience of the autonomy of an aesthetic object has become a&nbsp;necessary condition of dominant bourgeois culture.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a> The critique of that&nbsp;autonomy shifts art production closer to the core subjects of the Marxist critique of capitalism –&nbsp;the critique of class society, the relations of production within&nbsp;it, and the alienated, exploited labor of the working classes. One of the questions arising from&nbsp;the social history of art therefore concerns the representation of the relations of production. In the painting and sculpture of the modern era we can see that&nbsp;the alienated worker is an underrepresented theme, with&nbsp;few notable examples, such as the work of Gustave Courbet.<a href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a> In the 20th century, if the figure of the worker becomes represented by traditional art forms, it is usually subordinate to the broader ideological aim, as in the case of such representations in totalitarian states.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a> The situation appears to be different in the case of representation techniques that&nbsp;arose within&nbsp;the period of industrialization, such as cinema. There, as we mentioned, the image of the factory workers is the foundational image. And while the cinema, as popular art, was considered distinct from&nbsp;the fine arts, contemporary practices blur those distinctions and open up possibilities for&nbsp;producing accounts with&nbsp;regard to both.</p> <p>Jonathan Beller described the cinematic mode of production as an all-encompassing visual culture, and its different formations, e.g. cinema or television, as “deterritorialized factories in which spectators work, that&nbsp;is, in which we perform value-productive labor.”<a href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a> Although it is important to maintain such a&nbsp;critical viewpoint on cinema, it is necessary to move beyond&nbsp;it in order to engage simultaneously with&nbsp;art and cinema –&nbsp;it is in fact necessary to situate ourselves in a&nbsp;more ambivalent position. That&nbsp;is offered by the field of video art, which emerged in the 1960s, in a&nbsp;time of soaring political activism and the increasing commercialization of art. Consumerist society came under&nbsp;strong criticism, as did the power structure projected onto&nbsp;it by television. When the first portable video camera was released by Sony in 1967, artists quickly began to exploit this&nbsp;new field of visual potentiality. Its foundation was interdisciplinary and experimental, being identified neither with&nbsp;the art world, nor with&nbsp;cinema or television. Examining video art in the context of cinema brings out a&nbsp;relation full of contradictions –&nbsp;in the matters of economies, politics, and the spatialities of films. As I&nbsp;hope is visible in my analysis, it is possible to find a&nbsp;common ground to discuss them all, handling their contradictory dynamics with&nbsp;appropriate care.</p> <p></p> <p>The following&nbsp;analysis focuses on three works of video art: Harun Farocki’s <em>Arbeiter verlassen die Fabrik </em>[<em>Workers Leaving the Factory</em>]<em></em>(1995); Steve McQueen’s <em>Gravesend</em> (2007); and Yuri Pattison’s <em>Outsourced Views, Visual Economies</em> (2013-2014). Farocki’s work investigates the subject of industrial wage-labor in 20th-century cinematography; McQueen’s film shows the postcolonial reality of coltan mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the most recent film, by Yuri Pattison, introduces the reality of immaterial labor. Its argument follows a&nbsp;simplified division between&nbsp;three modes of labor derived predominantly from&nbsp;Marx’s <em>Capital</em>,<em></em>and analyses works that&nbsp;remain in close connection to mainstream cinematographic production or its virtual extensions. Therefore, while trying to find a&nbsp;position between&nbsp;art and cinema, it doesn’t engage with&nbsp;the subjects of domestic labor,<a href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a> video art emerging from&nbsp;the feminist movement (as in the work of Martha Rosler), or research-based installations such as <em>Women and Work: A&nbsp;Document on the Division of Labour in Industry 1973-75 </em>by Margaret Harrison, Kay Hunt, and Mary Kelly.</p> <p>A similar study regarding&nbsp;the Fordist and post-Fordist models of production was developed by Michael Goddard and Benjamin Halligan in relation to mainstream cinematic production.<a href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a> Their analysis applies an internal differentiation between&nbsp;biopolitical<a href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a> and immaterial labor,<a href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a> both of which are active and realized in the film industry. Their argument moves from&nbsp;classical cinema and its representation of Fordist models of work, to contemporary art-house cinema with&nbsp;its images of affective, immaterial labor. The following&nbsp;essay shares Goddard and Halligan’s approach, but&nbsp;moves the observation point towards&nbsp;the edge between&nbsp;cinematic and artistic production. Doing so, it aims to occupy a&nbsp;position that&nbsp;would enable further and deeper elaborations of relations between&nbsp;art, cinema, and representations of work and workers in both fields.</p> <h2>Part I: Workers Leaving the Factory</h2> <p>“The film <em>Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory in Lyon</em> (1895) by the brothers Louis and Auguste Lumière is forty-five seconds long and shows the roughly one hundred workers at the factory for&nbsp;photographic goods in Lyon-Montplaisir leaving the factory through&nbsp;two gates and exiting the frame to both sides.”<a href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a> This&nbsp;sentence opens an essay accompanying Harun Farocki’s work <em>Arbeiter verlassen die Fabrik</em>, produced in 1995. In its original form a&nbsp;one-channel projection lasting 36 minutes, the piece evolved 10 years later into&nbsp;the 12-screen video installation now in the collection of Tate Modern.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a> It is an emblematic work for&nbsp;Farocki’s practice, being at once artistic, critical, and yet situated within&nbsp;the film industry. This&nbsp;film-essay is a&nbsp;Lumière-inspired inquiry into&nbsp;the image of workers in the history of cinema. Viewers observe how –&nbsp;movie by movie, factory by factory, worker after&nbsp;worker –&nbsp;cinema has depicted the same scene. Farocki, the filmmaker, doesn’t use any of his own interpretation of the subject; rather, he assembles the cinematic works of others: Charlie Chaplin’s <em>Modern Times</em>;<em></em>Fritz Lang’s <em>Metropolis</em>;<em></em>Andrzej Wajda’s <em>Man of Iron</em>;<em></em>Michelangelo Antonioni’s <em>Red Desert</em>;<em></em>as well as propaganda materials from&nbsp;Nazi-era Germany and other found footage. The ever-changing images are accompanied by the calm voice of a&nbsp;female narrator reading the abovementioned essay. The director here becomes more of a&nbsp;prophetic archeologist, who excavates the obscure matter of the past, only to invent it anew for&nbsp;the sake of the present.<a href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8177-1-PB-1920x-47d.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8177-1-PB-330x-21a.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8177-1-PB-660x-651.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8177-1-PB-768x-14f.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8177-1-PB-1320x-56e.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8177-1-PB-660x-651.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Harun Farocki, <em>Arbeiter verlassen die Fabrik</em> [Workers Leaving the Factory], 1995.

The worker undergoes a&nbsp;metamorphosis from&nbsp;being a&nbsp;tool in the process to becoming a&nbsp;mere implement of the mechanical behemoth that&nbsp;is the factory.

The gesture of the accumulation of similar images produces the possibility of grasping the universal conditions of filmic expression –&nbsp;the factory is a&nbsp;frame; the worker is clearly differentiated from&nbsp;the rest of society within&nbsp;its boundaries. When the workers leave the factory this&nbsp;potential for&nbsp;filmic recognition is lost.<a href="#sdfootnote30sym" name="sdfootnote30anc"><sup>30</sup></a> Simultaneously, in such an accumulation the individual parts of the collage are differentiated by the political conditions of their setting –&nbsp;which underlines the political framing of what is visible –&nbsp;as in the instance of the employees and workers from&nbsp;Siemens in Berlin in 1934 leaving the factory in order to join a&nbsp;Nazi rally.

As Mbembe suggests, it is actually due to such approaches that&nbsp;historiography, anthropology, and feminist critique reduced the complex phenomenon of power to the matters of discourse and representation, rendering its subjects devoid of material existence. For&nbsp;the author this&nbsp;is particularly visible in the context of discussions concerning&nbsp;the African continent, utilizing discourses based on colonial domination, deeply embedded in classical European philosophy of the self and freedom.<a href="#sdfootnote31sym" name="sdfootnote31anc"><sup>31</sup></a> According to the author, “[…] it is this&nbsp;elementariness and primitiveness that&nbsp;makes Africa the world par excellence of all that&nbsp;is incomplete, mutilated, and unfinished, its history reduced to a&nbsp;series of setbacks of nature in its quest for&nbsp;humankind.”<a href="#sdfootnote32sym" name="sdfootnote32anc"><sup>32</sup></a></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8187-1-PB-1920x-ad0.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8187-1-PB-330x-a56.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8187-1-PB-660x-3cd.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8187-1-PB-768x-f6b.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8187-1-PB-1320x-5ef.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8187-1-PB-660x-3cd.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Steve McQueen, <em>Gravesend</em>, 2007.

In the 2007 film installation <em>Gravesend</em>, Steve McQueen –&nbsp;for&nbsp;the second time in his practice –&nbsp;casts the lens of his camera onto&nbsp;miners.<a href="#sdfootnote33sym" name="sdfootnote33anc"><sup>33</sup></a> This&nbsp;18-minute, 35 mm video engages with&nbsp;the dialectics between&nbsp;manual and mechanical labor in the neocolonial context. The single-screen projection in a&nbsp;dark art-gallery room assembles images from&nbsp;a&nbsp;coltan mine in DR Congo, the English port of Gravesend, and an almost fully mechanized assembly line located in Derby, England. Coltan is the common name for&nbsp;the mineral tantalum, which is widely used in the production of modern high-performance electronics such as smartphones and laptops. The mineral is found in different parts of the world, but&nbsp;since the early 2000s its price has soared, and mining companies have turned towards&nbsp;less-regulated ways of extracting it. To be precise, they started seeking the ore in DR Congo, which has the greatest deposits. The spike in prices is in direct relation to one of the deadliest conflicts since&nbsp;World War II –&nbsp;the Second Congo War, fueled by the market for&nbsp;the ore. McQueen surprisingly chooses not to point in this&nbsp;direction at all. His film instead draws its power from&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple juxtaposition of the black bodies of miners digging with&nbsp;bare hands or unsophisticated tools, and the clean, hygienic environment of high-tech machines operating on the Derby assembly line. As T. J. Demos writes in his recent book: “McQueen […] convey[s] savagery through&nbsp;phenomenological estrangement. […] <em>Gravesend</em> nevertheless mounts a&nbsp;political challenge by rendering visible those typically excluded from&nbsp;globalization’s imaginary.”<a href="#sdfootnote34sym" name="sdfootnote34anc"><sup>34</sup></a> Moreover, McQueen traces the technological innovations and commodities consumed and treated as something neutral, scientific, and symbolically “clean” back to the process of messy, bloody, and deadly primitive accumulation.</p> <p>This is a&nbsp;crucial insight, which can add to broadening our perspective on the uneven and violent process of globalization, and to understanding the perspective chosen by McQueen in <em>Gravesend</em>. The process of frontier capitalism and colonization, which takes us back to the early days of global exploration, also points our attention to the fundamental object of the worldview conceived in that&nbsp;period, namely the map. The map, the ultimate political tool of colonization, renders the world as reduced and horizontal. As it was then, so it is now: the horizontal view is embedded in any academic or non-academic conversation regarding&nbsp;globalization, capitalism, and war. Stephen Graham, in his recent book <em>Vertical</em>, aims to bring a&nbsp;different axis into&nbsp;being, enabling and exposing the verticality of systems of oppression and exploitation in the contemporary world.<a href="#sdfootnote35sym" name="sdfootnote35anc"><sup>35</sup></a> Beginning with&nbsp;satellites orbiting around&nbsp;the Earth, Graham’s analysis looks at the deepest frontiers of global capitalism –&nbsp;the Mponeng gold mine in Johannesburg, reaching a&nbsp;depth of four kilometers into&nbsp;the planet’s surface. Following&nbsp;contemporary works in geography, Graham points to studies that&nbsp;connect global cities –&nbsp;with&nbsp;their clean, sleek high-rises –&nbsp;to corporate mines deep under&nbsp;the Earth’s crust, which, day by day, exploit the Earth to an ever-increasing extent: “Globally, the uranium, diamond and metals mining industries were worth $80 billion in 1995; by 2008, they were worth $463 billion.”<a href="#sdfootnote36sym" name="sdfootnote36anc"><sup>36</sup></a></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8189-1-PB-1920x-47d.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8189-1-PB-330x-21a.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8189-1-PB-660x-651.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8189-1-PB-768x-14f.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8189-1-PB-1320x-56e.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8189-1-PB-660x-651.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Steve McQueen, <em>Gravesend</em>, 2007.

Using the medium of cinema in the context of art, McQueen goes beyond&nbsp;the horizontality of global vision, stepping down&nbsp;into a&nbsp;hidden, underground frontier. The imaginary of <em>Gravesend</em> transcends the boundaries of documentary or journalistic filmmaking, which would expose the bodies of miners according to the aesthetics of global reporting, aiming for&nbsp;the viewer’s “bleeding-heart” engagement. The vividness of the imagery, which makes visible and brings to our attention the whole infrastructural system of exploitation, comes with&nbsp;the artistic usage of aesthetically sharp and “materialist” imaginaries. These manifest themselves in depictions of the purity of the laboratory environments of Derby, but&nbsp;even more so in those of the materiality of the mining process, where detailed visual relations shift our attention towards&nbsp;the particular moment when the body, the tool of the miner, digs into&nbsp;the humid red clay of the coltan pit in DR Congo. It is the contrast between&nbsp;the representation of cold matter and the warm, living body which produces tension, tension that&nbsp;we can refer to as political. It is particularly African workers, who –&nbsp;as a&nbsp;result of the historical processes of slavery, colonialism, and frontier exploitation –&nbsp;are denied any subjectivity in contemporary discourses.</p> <h2>Part III: Amazon Mechanical Turk</h2> <p>At first glance, the film installation<em> Outsourced Views, Visual Economies</em> relates neither to the history of film and labor, nor to the market reality of the laborer. The video provides the viewer with&nbsp;a&nbsp;sequence of ambient landscapes shot by cameras with&nbsp;different qualities. The screen is doubled, and the first frame in the center of the image shows immobile pictures of landscapes, both urban and rural. In the background, similar kinds of images are shown in a&nbsp;dynamic film version. No humans are present in these environments; we can only observe solitary buildings, cars, construction sites, trees, lawns, sand, and sky. The images evoke melancholia, at times seeming to be glimpses of a&nbsp;post-apocalyptic future; at other times they look familiar, as if we could have shot them ourselves. The video alone does not give us any valuable information about&nbsp;what we see, hinting only by the means of its title.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8191-1-PB-1920x-47d.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8191-1-PB-330x-21a.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8191-1-PB-660x-651.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8191-1-PB-768x-14f.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8191-1-PB-1320x-56e.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8191-1-PB-660x-651.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Yuri Pattison, <em>Outsourced Views, Visual Economies</em>, 2013-2014. digital video files and photographies.

The name of the tool is derived from&nbsp;an 18th-century fake automaton, built to play (and win) the game of chess, which actually turned out to be a&nbsp;man hiding inside&nbsp;the cabinet of something that&nbsp;only looked like&nbsp;a&nbsp;machine.<a href="#sdfootnote38sym" name="sdfootnote38anc"><sup>38</sup></a> The apparatus was an environment for&nbsp;a&nbsp;human body –&nbsp;a&nbsp;disguise, a&nbsp;trick. And this&nbsp;is exactly what the Amazon platform also is: a&nbsp;crowd of human workers merged into&nbsp;digital machinery. As the networked society emerged and many businesses became digital, new needs arouse, specific to the highly technological environment of the web. The Mechanical Turk is a&nbsp;platform invented to resolve problems, which appeared at the intersection of the human-machine encounter. As we read on the MT website: “[AMT] is based on the idea that&nbsp;there are still many things that&nbsp;human beings can do much more effectively than&nbsp;computers, such as identifying objects in a&nbsp;photo or video, performing data de-duplication, transcribing audio recordings, or researching data details.”<a href="#sdfootnote39sym" name="sdfootnote39anc"><sup>39</sup></a> These “things” are called HITs, which stands for&nbsp;Human Intelligence Tasks. This&nbsp;can easily be characterized as the ultimate realization of the capitalist dream and the workers’ nightmare: the employer using machines as the most efficient and quantitatively manageable employees, and if those machines cannot perform certain commands, they can be cheaply and easily substituted by humans. But&nbsp;these human laborers are treated as machines themselves –&nbsp;they earn wages that&nbsp;cannot possibly provide them with&nbsp;the means of subsistence (a single HIT can cost as little as $0.001).<a href="#sdfootnote40sym" name="sdfootnote40anc"><sup>40</sup></a> They work remotely, allowing the employer to cut all other factory-labor-related costs, and they don’t benefit in any way from&nbsp;their workplace, as in reality they face the work alone. Their work is also strictly controllable and manageable by numbers –&nbsp;the ideal solution for&nbsp;problems that&nbsp;have “troubled” capitalists since&nbsp;the industrial era.<a href="#sdfootnote41sym" name="sdfootnote41anc"><sup>41</sup></a></p> <p>The technology introduced by Amazon is a&nbsp;step in the ceaseless process of the commodification and accumulation of surplus value from&nbsp;laboring bodies. It points towards&nbsp;a&nbsp;simplified realization of what Italian post-operaist thinkers such as Maurizio Lazzarato tend to characterize as immaterial labor. It may seem that&nbsp;the work performed to fulfill the so-called HITs is similar to the Fordist mode of factory work, but&nbsp;set in a&nbsp;hyper-connected environment characterized by Manuel Castells as the “networked society.”<a href="#sdfootnote42sym" name="sdfootnote42anc"><sup>42</sup></a> However, the concept of immaterial labor introduces more complex insights into&nbsp;the traditional division between&nbsp;mental and manual labor. It is defined in an essay by Lazzarato as “the labor that&nbsp;produces the informational and cultural content of the commodity.”<a href="#sdfootnote43sym" name="sdfootnote43anc"><sup>43</sup></a> Immaterial labor merges several divisions that&nbsp;traditionally occurred within&nbsp;the capitalist division of labor. It involves workers manually in a&nbsp;certain process, i.e. digital communication, and intellectually, in the process of decision-making. HITs involve manual labor characterized by efficiency, calculability, and predictability, but&nbsp;at their core lies the difference between&nbsp;the human and the machine –&nbsp;the difference of sensibility.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8193-1-PB-1920x-47d.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8193-1-PB-330x-21a.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8193-1-PB-660x-651.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8193-1-PB-768x-14f.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8193-1-PB-1320x-56e.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/21/the_disappearance_of_the_working/602-8193-1-PB-660x-651.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Yuri Pattison, <em>Outsourced Views, Visual Economies</em>, 2013-2014. digital video files and photographies. Courtesy of the artist.</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>According to the leaflet accompanying <em>Outsourced Views</em>, the images we see in the video were made by the workers of the Mechanical Turk’s engine. The request for&nbsp;them was placed on the platform and paid for&nbsp;by the artist himself. The neutral, vague landscapes at once become filled with&nbsp;meaning –&nbsp;meaning that&nbsp;produces the feelings of disappearance and ambivalence. We do not catch a&nbsp;glimpse of the workers’ faces or bodies; we are only shown the spaces and environments of their existence. Their bodies have disappeared through&nbsp;the work they perform; they have become machines situated in the landscapes of the modern world –&nbsp;from&nbsp;a&nbsp;tropical island to an American desert. The artist’s decision to pay the workers to film their surroundings is a&nbsp;gesture of handing over&nbsp;the medium of film to them at a&nbsp;moment when there is no factory from&nbsp;which they could emerge –&nbsp;there are only their homes and computer interfaces, which constitute the basis of AMT production. Pattison invited those AMT workers for&nbsp;whom the platform is the main source of income. Their identities are not acknowledged as, through&nbsp;the process, their labor is detached from&nbsp;them. Yet in this&nbsp;instance we can suspect that&nbsp;the decision to turn the camera from&nbsp;the workers fulfilling the task towards&nbsp;the outside&nbsp;world is a&nbsp;crucial part of Pattison’s idea. The artist makes the workers film and look outside, to point out how the dematerialized process of production has left behind&nbsp;the temporal and spatial restrictions imposed by factory work.</p> <h2>Conclusion: Appearance and Autonomy</h2> <p>The Lumière’s foundational image in the film <em>Workers </em><em>Leaving the Lumière Factory </em>placed the attention of the first audiences on the movement of workers emerging from&nbsp;the factory in Lyon. They appeared contained within&nbsp;the frame, just as they were contained within&nbsp;the space of the factory. At the time of its original screening their movement was not alien to the audience, since&nbsp;cinema constituted the commercial medium that&nbsp;mobilized the wide scope of society –&nbsp;the mass audience. As we saw, this&nbsp;image became the basis for&nbsp;Farocki’s historical and artistic inquiry, which posed the question about&nbsp;the place of workers’ representation within&nbsp;cinematic representation. Through&nbsp;the artist’s montage we are able to see a&nbsp;visual tradition, a&nbsp;way in which the workers’ image persisted within&nbsp;the field from&nbsp;its beginnings. Simultaneously, Farocki’s critical commentary included in the piece underlines the ambiguous absence that&nbsp;truly characterizes relations between&nbsp;labor and cinema –&nbsp;an absence that&nbsp;is not imposed by the formal restrictions of the medium, but&nbsp;rather by its deep connection to capitalist aesthetic formations and ideologies.</p> <p>McQueen’s <em>Gravesend</em> transgressed traditional cinematographic modes of imaging, to approach the subject of work in the context of geographical and ideological displacements imposed by colonial and neocolonial economies. The work exposes the continuity and efficiency of infrastructure and production that&nbsp;cannot be fully comprehended by the viewer. The process of coltan mining challenges our understanding of the economy behind&nbsp;everyday objects, as it operates on a&nbsp;global scale with&nbsp;efficiency imposed by technological advancement. Simultaneously, occluded at its roots by spatial and political conditions, it operates with&nbsp;the most violent and deadly force. McQueen shows how, within&nbsp;the postcolonial era, the “Other” is maintained as a&nbsp;figure to work in slave conditions of terror, producing cheap raw materials to feed the mechanized factories and technologically advanced commodities consumed in the global North. Aesthetically, it is the most sophisticated of the movies discussed, restricting itself at the same time to pure exposition of the process, suggesting the impossibility of giving any promise of change or of taking a&nbsp;stand other than&nbsp;the one behind&nbsp;the camera.</p> <p>Only in our last example, <em>Outsourced Views</em>, does the artist actually engage with&nbsp;the workers, mediating the interaction through&nbsp;the digital means activated by their labor. Yuri Pattison chooses to include himself in the production and consumption system, within&nbsp;the framework set by the machinery of Amazon. We can suppose that&nbsp;the artist was driven by the impossibility of approaching the workers of the AMT in any other way; he couldn’t stand outside&nbsp;the factory and talk to them while they left their workplace. Their deterritorialization by means of interfaces, conditioned by the extraction of surplus value from&nbsp;immaterial labor, renders them scattered and hidden inside&nbsp;private apartments. They are asked to point their cameras towards&nbsp;the outside&nbsp;world, to show the artist and the audience what they see, and simultaneously to see it themselves. Watching the video with&nbsp;Farocki’s work in mind, we are able to observe how the capitalist system rendered the worker mediated and occluded within&nbsp;sets of technologies and procedures. Simultaneously, the same system became freed from&nbsp;the spatial and temporal obstructions and restrictions imposed on it by the historical form of the factory.</p> <p>Introducing his work on the cultural development of perception in the 19th century, Jonathan Crary states that&nbsp;“[…] spectacular culture is not founded on the necessity of making a&nbsp;subject <em>see</em>,<em></em>but rather on strategies in which individuals are isolated, separated, and <em>inhabit time </em>as disempowered.”<a href="#sdfootnote44sym" name="sdfootnote44anc"><sup>44</sup></a> The three works of Farocki, McQueen, and Pattison use the medium of film in the task of representing the workers who, in mainstream cinematic production, became particularly “isolated,” “disempowered,” or just never existed within&nbsp;it. Each of those artworks inhabits and exhibits different paradoxes, tensions, and procedures that&nbsp;exist within&nbsp;the relation between&nbsp;the medium of film and the image of workers and their labor. Using their insight, we were able to observe how the process described by Crary is realized both within&nbsp;the field of cinema and in the system of production itself: namely, how the type of work –&nbsp;its geographies and mobilized means of production –&nbsp;shapes the visibility and appearance of the working class. The disappearing of the working class can therefore be understood not as a&nbsp;definite and concluded process, but&nbsp;rather as a&nbsp;set of obstacles, both within&nbsp;the medium and outside&nbsp;it. These obstacles are produced and reproduced by the material and ideological conditions of capitalist production. It is an overarching process, which includes the whole of society; it shapes all of its layers, despite&nbsp;the claims of autonomy in regard to culture and the sensibility of the middle and upper classes. And while acknowledging that, we can see how the figure of the worker becomes crucial to observe. It is a&nbsp;figure in the foundations of the whole structure. It is with&nbsp;the representation of the worker that&nbsp;we are able to approach the entirety of the process, in order to grasp it and potentially make it appear vividly before&nbsp;us.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div>
