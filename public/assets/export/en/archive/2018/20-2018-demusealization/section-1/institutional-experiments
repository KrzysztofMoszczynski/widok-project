				<section class="u-typo">   <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>This paper will review the theoretical implications of experiments undertaken in recent years by leading institutions devoted to contemporary art, experiments interpreted as progressive responses to the dissolution of the autonomy of art. I&nbsp;will refer to such examples as the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (MIMA), SALT in Istanbul, Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven (VAM), Tensta Konsthall in Stockholm, the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw, BAK and CASCO from&nbsp;Utrecht, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid (Museo Reina Sofía), the International Association and Museum of Arte Útil (Arte Útil meaning “useful art”), and the L’internationale coalition of European museums. I&nbsp;will analyze how these institutions –&nbsp;searching for&nbsp;a&nbsp;new formula called the “Museum 3.0” –&nbsp;are transforming themselves by supporting artistic practices that&nbsp;transgress the conventions of autonomous art and by establishing connections with&nbsp;their publics (reframed as constituents and users). I&nbsp;will argue that&nbsp;in doing so, these institutions are reformulating distinctions fundamental to the modernist institution of art, such as the distinction between&nbsp;high art and popular culture, symbolic and financial value, aesthetic uselessness and instrumental use, refined and low taste, a&nbsp;proper bourgeois public and its deviant Others (women, workers, and colonized people), and the institutional inside&nbsp;and outside. Such institutions are championed as progressive responses to the double challenge posed by neoliberal capitalism and aggressive nationalism. As stated by Jesús Carrillo, former director of public programs at the Museo Reina Sofia:</p> <blockquote>The very concept of the public institution is under&nbsp;siege both by corporations that&nbsp;seek to take it over&nbsp;and use its prestige for&nbsp;their own interests, and by reactionary powers who have established culture as a&nbsp;battlefield on which to fight their ‘culture wars’ against&nbsp;the coming of ‘barbarians', being either ‘radicals’ or, simply, “common people’. The democratization of our cultural institutions is the only vaccine against&nbsp;this state of affairs. It should affect its different stages: management structures, labor organization, decision-making methods, programming, budget, and the very definition of the architecture and the circulation of people.<a href="#sdfootnote1sym" name="sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a></blockquote>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/01d-1920x-729.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/01d-330x-dec.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/01d-660x-7c9.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/01d-768x-fde.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/01d-1320x-6e0.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/01d-660x-7c9.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Museum with&nbsp;traces of being used, commissioned for&nbsp;the exhibition <em>Making Use.

I&nbsp;propose here to consider such formulations not as mere empty rhetoric, but&nbsp;as signals of an institutional revival which responds not only to rising authoritarianism and rampant capitalism, but&nbsp;also -&nbsp;or even especially -&nbsp;to the ongoing process of the dissolution of artistic autonomy.</p> <p>The examples of progressive institutional experiments which I&nbsp;am going to discuss here continue the traditions of new institutionalism from&nbsp;the 1990s and 2000s, a&nbsp;movement to reform contemporary art institutions by implementing progressive ideals in institutional praxis.<a href="#sdfootnote2sym" name="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a> Some of the people quoted here –&nbsp;such as Maria Lind or Charles Esche –&nbsp;were active proponents of this&nbsp;movement back in its heyday. Respectively, some of the institutions to which I&nbsp;refer, like&nbsp;VAM, Museo Reina Sofia or Moderna Galerija, have already been analyzed as iterations of radical museology.<a href="#sdfootnote3sym" name="sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a> During&nbsp;the recent decade, when the notions and models discussed here originated, the democratic crisis and the acceleration of global capitalism escalated, threatening the very existence of the social institution of autonomous art, to a&nbsp;point where its current and future existence cannot be taken for&nbsp;granted.</p> <h2>The dissolution of artistic autonomy</h2> <p>Progressive artistic institutions experiment with&nbsp;their apparatuses in a&nbsp;socio-political landscape changed by the tectonic shifts caused by the eroding autonomy of art. In the assumption that&nbsp;the social institutions and ideological edifices, which support the autonomy of art, have weakened or even dissolved (both in response to external pressures and as a&nbsp;result of internal developments), I&nbsp;am merely following&nbsp;a&nbsp;host of other scholars and practitioners, who have analyzed this&nbsp;process and its implications since&nbsp;the 1970s. One of the most interesting takes on the conceptual dynamics of this&nbsp;process was formulated by Jerzy Ludwiński, whose theories of art in a&nbsp;post-artistic age responded to what he perceived as the dissolution of art as a&nbsp;result of the conceptual revolution in art as early as the 1970s. In 1971 Ludwiński declared: “Perhaps, even today, we do not deal with&nbsp;art. We might have overlooked the moment when it transformed itself into&nbsp;something else, something which we cannot yet name.

In contrast to Ludwiński, I&nbsp;use this&nbsp;term with&nbsp;deliberate irony, as I&nbsp;discuss the dissolution of autonomous art in the social and economic circuits of late capitalism, almost half a&nbsp;century after&nbsp;Ludwiński formulated his optimistic vision. Even though the dissolution I&nbsp;have in mind is a&nbsp;process of a&nbsp;different ilk, I&nbsp;am very far from&nbsp;deriding it for&nbsp;being outright negative. I&nbsp;consider the dissolution of the institutional and ideological framework sustaining artistic autonomy from&nbsp;a&nbsp;more dialectic standpoint, as an opportunity to progressively reach out beyond&nbsp;its eroding boundaries.</p> <p>While analyzing the process of dissolution, it is important not to idealise the modernist notion of autonomy. The modernist institution of autonomous art, or more precisely –&nbsp;the autonomous field of artistic production –&nbsp;has been thoroughly analyzed in the social theory of art. The field of autonomous art formed an ever-expanding ideological and institutional framework, which conferred the status of art on “mere” objects and enabled attribution of their authorship. The field was constituted by social relations between&nbsp;artists, critics, gallerists, curators, and various institutions (i.e. museums, galleries, magazines), with&nbsp;its own market and capitals, based on a&nbsp;relatively autonomous system of values, in which symbolic recognition might count more than&nbsp;direct financial rewards. As Pierre Bourdieu (among many others) analyzed in his insightful treatises on the rules of art, even in its heyday the bourgeoisie field of art was part of the field of power — art was a&nbsp;way of acquiring status, art works were sold, art careers were limited to people who could afford such sacrifices, and refined tastes were a&nbsp;way of creating social distinctions.<a href="#sdfootnote6sym" name="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>6</sup></a> But, as Bourdieu emphasizes, the ideal of artistic autonomy was a&nbsp;foundational concept for&nbsp;this specific field, which in the name of art resisted external influences, derided the shallowness of capitalism, and despised bourgeoisie values. Obviously, modernist art institutions contributed to national and colonial projects, as analyzed by Tony Bennett referring to examples of 19<sup>th</sup> century museums.<a href="#sdfootnote7sym" name="sdfootnote7anc"><sup>7</sup></a> But&nbsp;they did so by concealing their own political embeddedness and appealing to universal ideals of aesthetics and reason, the resulting tension identified and disrupted by institutional critique.</p> <p>Alexander Alberro underlines the fact that&nbsp;proponents of institutional critique from&nbsp;the 1960s onwards (such as Hans Haacke, Fred Wilson, Marcel Broodthaers, or Andrea Fraser) challenged corrupted forms of artistic institutions in the name of the ideals that&nbsp;these institutions were supposed to uphold.<a href="#sdfootnote8sym" name="sdfootnote8anc"><sup>8</sup></a> Writing in a&nbsp;similar vein, Lucy Lippard expressed her disappointment with&nbsp;the failed promises of conceptual art, which by the 1970s had already been commercialized by the gallery system.<a href="#sdfootnote9sym" name="sdfootnote9anc"><sup>9</sup></a> Working on a&nbsp;more theoretical level, Peter Bürger criticized the second wave of the avant-garde from&nbsp;the 1960s and 1970s precisely for&nbsp;its unwillingness to breach the boundaries of artistic autonomy. In his opinion, the artists of this&nbsp;period performed their critique from&nbsp;the inside&nbsp;of the institution being criticized, thus forestalling a&nbsp;more radical program of abolishing strictures of alienation specific to the modernist autonomy.<a href="#sdfootnote10sym" name="sdfootnote10anc"><sup>10</sup></a> Similar tropes reverberate in the texts of Andrea Fraser, who blames the situation of being “inside” the field for&nbsp;eradicating the possibility to transform or even justifiably criticize its structures.<a href="#sdfootnote11sym" name="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a> According to her argument, any attempt to move beyond&nbsp;art only expands the field of autonomous art, absorbing and neutralizing its critique. Writing in the context of new institutionalism and relational aesthetics, Stephen Wright criticized the power of the performative framework of art to capture even the most radical of actions or ideas as “just art,” thereby neutralizing their potential use values by turning them into&nbsp;marketable, collectible, and authored objects of aesthetic contemplation.<a href="#sdfootnote12sym" name="sdfootnote12anc"><sup>12</sup></a></p> <p>The dissolution of artistic autonomy has many causes and facets, some of them external, others related to internal developments in the field. To explain the transformation in the status of art and culture in the Americas of the early 2000s, George Yúdice mentions the political and economic aftermath of 1990s globalisation, changes in cultural policy after&nbsp;the end of the cold war, and the proliferation of new funding sources, which expected art to be utilized beyond&nbsp;its own field.<a href="#sdfootnote13sym" name="sdfootnote13anc"><sup>13</sup></a> One should not underestimate the exponential growth and global connectivity of artistic circulation, which emerged in this&nbsp;period. Galleries, fairs, consultancies, art schools, foundations, biennials, journals, email lists –&nbsp;all devoted to contemporary art –&nbsp;have mushroomed everywhere, orienting the trajectories of tens of thousands of people worldwide, while connecting them globally. With&nbsp;the rise of global art worlds, the autonomous fields of artistic production, previously stabilized by the boundaries of national cultures, dissolved into&nbsp;a&nbsp;global circulation of art and people<a href="#sdfootnote14sym" name="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>14</sup></a>.</p> <p>This circulation is partially integrated in the economic circuits of financial capitalism, subsuming artistic pretences to autonomy. Subsuming autonomy does not mean its total eradication, but&nbsp;rather its significant rewiring. As the modernist institution of art crumbles, different agents use art for&nbsp;their own benefit, subsuming its autonomous value. In the late capitalist, global circulation of art, masterpieces are not only revered but&nbsp;also blatantly utilized as tourist attractions by museums that&nbsp;have refashioned themselves as global brands. When nationalists redefine the field of art, museums openly identify themselves as guardians of national cultures, their artefacts mustered as if they were soldiers in culture wars, not even veiled by humanist ideals.</p> <p>When art was more firmly embedded in the institutions of autonomy, it was revered as a&nbsp;priceless object of eternal value. Currently, it is not only aesthetically contemplated, but&nbsp;also marketed, swapped, banked upon, auctioned, evaluated, indexed, incorporated as one of the markets of financial capitalism, propelling fast and speculative growth in the evaluations of assets, skyrocketing despite&nbsp;the largest financial crisis since&nbsp;the 1930s. In this&nbsp;capitalist mode of artistic distribution, analyzed by Luc Boltanski, the exhibition value of a&nbsp;given piece is attributed as a&nbsp;result of market operations, dictated by grand collectors who push up prices –&nbsp;considered to be indicators of artistic value –&nbsp;alongside dealers and other speculators.<a href="#sdfootnote15sym" name="sdfootnote15anc"><sup>15</sup></a> However, the value of art has not diminished, it is still partially embedded in its symbolic appreciation, but&nbsp;now it is featured as just one of many factors among&nbsp;others. Analogical analysis could be applied to other tenets of artistic autonomy, for&nbsp;example disinterested spectatorship has transformed into&nbsp;the ostentatious ownership of artistic objects. Same applies to the social status of artistic trades. From&nbsp;being a&nbsp;sacrificial vocation, art has become a&nbsp;profession, a&nbsp;viable career path for&nbsp;many, but&nbsp;for the sake of which people are still eager to risk precarity or outright poverty.</p> <p>The late capitalist dissolution of artistic autonomy is matched by the authoritarian assault on the autonomy of art in countries undergoing a&nbsp;nationalist turn, such as Russia, Turkey, Hungary or Poland. The subsumption of autonomy to an authoritarian state works via&nbsp;possibly less subtle, but&nbsp;even more efficient, means of reshaping cultural policies and legal systems. Interestingly though, just as Walter Benjamin warned decades ago, the power of art is not eradicated, but&nbsp;rather redirected to aestheticize the power of the authoritarian state.<a href="#sdfootnote16sym" name="sdfootnote16anc"><sup>16</sup></a> In this&nbsp;regard, the dissolution of autonomy is paired with&nbsp;the rise of international fascism.</p> <h2>Institutions of eroding autonomy</h2>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/03d-1920x-df5.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/03d-330x-dea.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/03d-660x-906.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/03d-768x-992.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/03d-1320x-d52.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/03d-660x-906.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p><em>Museum of 1%</em>, action at the façade of the Guggenheim Museum in New York using the OWS Illuminator van, 2014, image courtesy of Noah Fischer and GULF</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>The same factors which contribute to the dissolution of artistic autonomy frequently imperil the functioning of public institutions of modern and contemporary art. This&nbsp;pressure is felt particularly intensely in Europe, not because it is stronger than&nbsp;elsewhere, but&nbsp;rather due to its existing structures of state patronage, which are prone to financial austerity and an authoritarian upsurge. As Hito Steyerl, Maria Lind and many others have argued, critical institutions are in a&nbsp;dire situation, because resources and influence are amassed at the top of the social hierarchy, imposing harsh austerity on the general public, jeopardizing public art institutions.<a href="#sdfootnote17sym" name="sdfootnote17anc"><sup>17</sup></a> The siphoning of wealth and clout has also had an impact on the general stability of democratic systems, as many countries slide towards&nbsp;right-wing populism. Indeed, every institution described here needs to cope with&nbsp;rapid transformation of public and political cultures –&nbsp;Brexit in the UK, an authoritarian government in Poland, a&nbsp;backlash against&nbsp;social movements in Spain, or a&nbsp;xenophobic shift in Dutch politics. Just as public art institutions are under&nbsp;threat, new institutional models emerge in response to -&nbsp;and as agents of -&nbsp;eroding autonomy. I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to highlight just two institutional models, which reconstitute institutional landscapes in accordance with&nbsp;the principles of either financial capitalism or a&nbsp;nationalist upsurge.</p> <p>On the one hand, one can observe a&nbsp;process of capitalist concentration in the institutional milieu, as a&nbsp;couple of larger museums and galleries (the Louvre, Tate, Guggenheim) expand as global brands, locating branches in Gulf states or elsewhere (Ross and Gulf Labor Artist Coalition 2015). This&nbsp;institutional form has been derided as a&nbsp;“museum of the 1%” by the art-activist collective Illuminator, affiliated with&nbsp;Occupy Museums and the Gulf Labor Coalition, who projected this&nbsp;label, alongside slogans such as “High Art Low Wages”, on the façade of the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Commenting on the situation in a&nbsp;New York-centered art world, Andrea Fraser has described the convergence between&nbsp;top artistic institutions and financial oligarchies.<a href="#sdfootnote18sym" name="sdfootnote18anc"><sup>18</sup></a> As she convincingly has argued, it is enough to just browse through&nbsp;the lists of art collectors, rankings of influential people, and the names of board members, to spot vast numbers of oligarchs, some of whom made money in the same financial crisis which impoverished multitudes. As she has argued, the art market indexes seem to be correlated with&nbsp;coefficients of inequality: the more wealth the rich amass, the more they spend on luxury products, art included. As the public sphere is ravaged, major artistic institutions become dependent on rich patrons, who, as Chin Tao Wu has explained in reference to such institutions as the Tate, gain prestige, justification and political access for&nbsp;the relatively miniscule costs of sponsorship.<a href="#sdfootnote19sym" name="sdfootnote19anc"><sup>19</sup></a> In time this&nbsp;habit has evolved into&nbsp;what Mel Evans has criticised as the outright art-washing of corporate reputations tarnished by ecological devastation or financial machinations.<a href="#sdfootnote20sym" name="sdfootnote20anc"><sup>20</sup></a> Under&nbsp;such circumstances, the glamour of art is instrumentally utilized to enhance corporate or individual image, while the autonomy of both art and public institutions is subsumed by external interests.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/04d-1920x-683.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/04d-330x-605.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/04d-660x-772.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/04d-768x-8c0.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/04d-1320x-1f7.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/04d-660x-772.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Museum 3.0, image commissioned for&nbsp;the exhibition <em>Making Use.

The autonomy of these institutions is subservient to the nationalist project. Artworks become markers of national identity, while museums propagate national glory, transforming themselves into&nbsp;stalwarts against&nbsp;otherness.</p> <p>Both the neoliberal and nationalist institutional models override the modernist institution of artistic autonomy, reassembling some of its edifices as components in their own projects –&nbsp;of financially-oligarchic and nationalist ilks, respectively. Their core mechanics are quite similar, as they decouple modernity from&nbsp;progressive promises of social emancipation and autonomy, while maintaining the fundamental exclusions inherent to the modernist project. In contrast, the progressive responses to the dissolution of autonomous art, described here, try to free modernity from&nbsp;the injustice and exploitation which underpinned it, while salvaging promises of emancipation and autonomy from&nbsp;the double threat of plutocracy and authoritarianism, thus formulating a&nbsp;progressive response to the dissolution of artistic autonomy.</p> <h2>In search of Museum 3.0</h2>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/05d-1920x-d38.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/05d-330x-6f6.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/05d-660x-881.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/05d-768x-4ca.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/05d-1320x-89b.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/05d-660x-881.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Tania Bruguera, <em>Talking to Power</em> (Hablándole al Poder), Yerba Buena Center for&nbsp;the Arts, San Francisco, 2017.

Hudson proposes to transgress the eroding boundaries of artistic autonomy in order to activate the social value of art and facilitate its uses, working hand in hand with&nbsp;museum constituents. Hudson deliberately talks about&nbsp;“constituents” and not publics or stakeholders, to emphasize a&nbsp;more politically charged relationship between&nbsp;the museum and the social groups, to the interest of which it wants to cater. Referencing the influential <em>Towards a&nbsp;Lexicon of Usership</em> (2013) by Stephen Wright, Hudson explains that&nbsp;the Museum 3.0 is “an idea of the museum that&nbsp;is built on usership, that&nbsp;is, a&nbsp;place that&nbsp;is created and given meaning by the sum actions of all its users”.<a href="#sdfootnote23sym" name="sdfootnote23anc"><sup>23</sup></a> The central tenet of this&nbsp;vision is the usefulness of art, which subsumes the notions of spectatorship, authorship, uselessness, and ownership, considered by Wright as conceptual edifices of modern art. The ambition of the Museum 3.0 is to facilitate what Wright calls artistic practices on a&nbsp;“one to one scale”, i.e. artistic concepts materialized in social praxis, which at the same time hold the promise of social utility and are bearers of aesthetic and conceptual values.<a href="#sdfootnote24sym" name="sdfootnote24anc"><sup>24</sup></a></p> <p>One of the central agents in the process of activating the social value of art in institutional practice is The Association for&nbsp;Useful Art, which comprises both the online database of the Museum of Arte Útil and local Offices for&nbsp;Useful Art, established and run by institutions such as Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, Liverpool John Moors University, and the already mentioned MIMA and SALT.<a href="#sdfootnote25sym" name="sdfootnote25anc"><sup>25</sup></a> It has been featured in many exhibition projects internationally, including the exhibition <em>Making Use.

Instead of serving as an institutional guardian of eternal values, the Museum 3.0 employs practices, which have been described by artist and thinker Rasheed Araeen as art beyond&nbsp;art. Araeen argues that&nbsp;in order to realise its social potential, art has to move beyond&nbsp;the limitations imposed on it by the bourgeois institution of art, founded on the very notion of ownership and authorship.<a href="#sdfootnote29sym" name="sdfootnote29anc"><sup>29</sup></a> To illustrate his thesis Araeen discusses Joseph Beuys’ <em>6000 oaks,</em> calling it a&nbsp;progressive action which did not fully realize its own potential because of the proprietary relationship between&nbsp;the artist and his work. Beuys had planted a&nbsp;mere six thousand oaks, while the scale of the ecological disaster demanded much more decisive action, which would have been possible if Beuys had just relinquished his authorial control and invited everyone to collectively share authorship of the idea.<a href="#sdfootnote30sym" name="sdfootnote30anc"><sup>30</sup></a> Araeen finds a&nbsp;full realization of this&nbsp;potential in the figure of Wangari Maathai, an activist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for&nbsp;her campaign to combat deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa, as a&nbsp;result of which not six thousand but&nbsp;millions of trees were planted. Arguing with&nbsp;Beuys, Araeen proposes an alternative ontology of art. He does not prioritise artistic objects, instead focusing on ideas as carriers of human creativity and unbridled imagination that&nbsp;–&nbsp;in their limited forms –&nbsp;are also represented in aesthetic formulas.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/08d-1920x-4ea.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/08d-330x-779.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/08d-660x-bfb.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/08d-768x-6b9.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/08d-1320x-54e.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/08d-660x-bfb.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Rasheed Araeen, <em>Arctic Circle</em>, reconstruction in the Sculpture Park in Brodno, Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw and Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven in 2017, image by Kuba Szreder</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>To redeem artistic creativity from&nbsp;the limitations imposed by the modernist institution of art, Araeen proposes to merge art with&nbsp;the collective flows of global creative resistance, in the process conceptualizing what art on a&nbsp;one to one scale could look like. In his essay <em>Return to Baluchistan</em>, he imagines a&nbsp;small dam, an artificial lake and a&nbsp;sustainable collective farm in the Pakistani desert. If realized, this&nbsp;dam would function as both a&nbsp;conceptual piece of art, created in cooperation between&nbsp;artist and the people living there, and a&nbsp;socially beneficial structure for&nbsp;the local populace. This&nbsp;concept has never been brought to fruition, even though, as Araeen claims, the execution of this&nbsp;idea would require only a&nbsp;modest readjustment of the financial and symbolic flows embedded in artistic circulation. This&nbsp;has not happened yet, but&nbsp;where individual artists falter, artistic institutions, with&nbsp;their resources and connections, might prevail.</p> <p>Continuing with&nbsp;my central argument, it is important to underline that&nbsp;institutions which subscribe to the program of the Museum 3.0, or champion social uses of art, do not eradicate the modernist institution of art entirely, but&nbsp;rather reassemble it. They use the resources, prestige and visibility of art and give them other uses, different from&nbsp;the ones promoted by neoliberal or nationalist museums. Neither Araeen nor the institutions mentioned are blinded by idealism. Araeen appreciates the world of art as a&nbsp;space where artistic ideas can be actualized, amplified, and communicated. Together with&nbsp;Sebastian Cichocki and Meagan Down, we have argued that&nbsp;Araeen’s dialectic take on artistic institutions has tremendous implications for&nbsp;rethinking institutional models.<a href="#sdfootnote31sym" name="sdfootnote31anc"><sup>31</sup></a> To support our argument, we discuss a&nbsp;reconstruction of <em>Arctic Circle</em> (1983), one of Araeen’s pieces, in the Sculpture Park in Bródno, organized in 2017 in cooperation between&nbsp;the Van Abbemuseum and the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw. The piece was “borrowed” from&nbsp;Van Abbemuseum, where at this&nbsp;time Araeen’s solo exhibition was under&nbsp;construction, but&nbsp;it travelled to Warsaw not as a&nbsp;physical object but&nbsp;as an intangible idea. Funding was spent on reconstructing the piece on the spot, with&nbsp;the help of local people, rather than&nbsp;by paying art handlers or insurance companies, who are usually involved in facilitating inter-institutional loans. In conclusion of this&nbsp;case study, we propose that&nbsp;art institutions can reimagine themselves as custodians of ideas, that&nbsp;can be applied everywhere by keen users, rather than&nbsp;collectors of valuable art objects. In this&nbsp;way, museums would be able to respond to the dissolution of autonomous objects of art, supporting the creative potential of the ideas that&nbsp;they represent, just as the Offices for&nbsp;Useful Art tend to do. In such situations, art institutions play a&nbsp;subsidiary role. Their collections are not considered to be final destinations or an oeuvre’s path to eternal recognition, but&nbsp;rather temporary shelters, where ideas can rest and grow for&nbsp;a&nbsp;while before&nbsp;being integrated with&nbsp;social praxis.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/09d-1920x-c23.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/09d-330x-c56.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/09d-660x-a45.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/09d-768x-1e3.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/09d-1320x-bcc.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/09d-660x-a45.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p><a href="09d.jpg"><img></a>Democratic Self-Administration of Rojava and New World Summit, New World Summit –&nbsp;Rojava, photograph Ruben Hamelink, courtesy New World Summit</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p>Another example of this&nbsp;dynamic could be the parliament for&nbsp;Rojava, designed by the studio of artist-architect-activist Jonas Staal. The idea for&nbsp;a&nbsp;stateless parliament originated during&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of events and actions conducted together under&nbsp;the auspices of New World Summits, the first of which was organized during&nbsp;the 7<sup>th</sup> Berlin Biennale in 2012; subsequent ones were supported by such institutions as BAK in Utrecht. Eventually though, Staal and his office made use of the mechanisms of artistic circulation (exhibitions, collections, visibility) to facilitate the construction of a&nbsp;parliament building in Rojava, in Syrian Kurdistan, supporting the democratic ambitions of a&nbsp;stateless political process. Even though the architectural mock-ups of the parliament were collected and exhibited (like, for&nbsp;example, during&nbsp;the Making Use exhibition, previously mentioned), this&nbsp;idea was fully realized in Dêrik, Canton Cizîrê, in the Rojava district, where it serves as a&nbsp;place for&nbsp;democratic assemblies.</p> <p>As Tania Bruguera argues in the context of the Museum of Arte Útil, its aim is to reinsert art into&nbsp;society, where it belongs, but&nbsp;from where it has been forcefully ejected by the conventions of modern art.<a href="#sdfootnote32sym" name="sdfootnote32anc"><sup>32</sup></a> The question is, though, how the difference between&nbsp;useful art and social praxis is negotiated. Even more important is the difference between&nbsp;the progressive uses of art, and how it is instrumentalized by the corporate or nationalist institutions, mentioned above. The difference, in my opinion, lies in the political context and conceptual nuance. Referring to the legacy of the Arts and Crafts movement, John Byrne argues that&nbsp;arte <em>útil </em>should not be misrepresented as an activity driven by instrumental reason, subsumed by capitalist logic and Taylorist efficiency, but&nbsp;rather understood as a&nbsp;“really useful” activity.<a href="#sdfootnote33sym" name="sdfootnote33anc"><sup>33</sup></a> “Really useful knowledge”, except&nbsp;lending itself as the title of an exhibition curated in Museo Reina Sofia by Croatian collective WHW (2014-2015), was a&nbsp;notion formulated by the British working classes in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Granted access by the bourgeoisie to education in trade, engineering, and simple accountancy, necessary to operate complex machinery, the workers rebelled. They demanded access to what they regarded as really useful knowledge –&nbsp;poetry, philosophy, art, sociology, astronomy. The common denominator in these –&nbsp;otherwise deemed not to be very practical -&nbsp;disciplines is their capacity to help one imagine the world otherwise, to think about&nbsp;society not as given and static but&nbsp;as potentially transformable. This&nbsp;capacity of art to “imagine otherwise” is lost when it becomes a&nbsp;consumerist object of late capitalist spectacle or a&nbsp;token of a&nbsp;nationalist identity project. It is reinvigorated when applied in social praxis by constituencies of users, who in the process of this&nbsp;actualization, turn the rules of society’s game upside down, such as when parading a&nbsp;wooden horse to a&nbsp;derelict housing district in Middlesbrough, thereby negotiating common access to land. It is activated when the denizens of Four Grandby Street in Liverpool, sourcing the expertise of architectural collective Assemble, managed to turn their derelict neighborhood into&nbsp;a&nbsp;housing cooperative, beautifying it in the process (which secured Assemble the Turner Prize in 2015). This&nbsp;is acting in 1:1 scale at full throttle, an act of rebellious imagination and pragmatic action in the same instance. And the Museum 3.0 aims to make this&nbsp;happen, repurposing its own structures with&nbsp;a&nbsp;vision of establishing new commons, that&nbsp;is infrastructures and resources, which are used by groups of commoners for&nbsp;a&nbsp;collective benefit, who test new modes of custodianship beyond&nbsp;the opposition between&nbsp;private ownership and state control.<a href="#sdfootnote34sym" name="sdfootnote34anc"><sup>34</sup></a></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/10d-1920x-2a3.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/10d-330x-8d5.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/10d-660x-528.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/10d-768x-2b6.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/10d-1320x-0d9.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/10d-660x-528.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p><em>Really Useful Knowledge</em>, curated by WHW, Museo de Reina Sofia, 2014-2015, image by Joaquín Cortés &amp; Román Lores, courtesy of MNCARS</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p><a href="#sdfootnote34sym" name="sdfootnote34anc"><sup></sup></a></p> <h2>From useful to constituent museums</h2> <p>In the discourses emerging in the context of L’internationale the concept of the useful museum is paired with&nbsp;the notion of the museum as a&nbsp;constituent entity, which responds to the dissolution of artistic autonomy by establishing links with&nbsp;constituencies that&nbsp;differ from&nbsp;its “natural” patronage and audience. Just like&nbsp;John Byrne writes in a&nbsp;reader on constituent museums, published by L’internationale:</p> <blockquote>[…] the normative physical, ideological and conceptual architecture of the museum -&nbsp;as a&nbsp;top down, curatorially driven construct for&nbsp;developing and disseminating knowledge -&nbsp;has become speculatively replaced with&nbsp;a&nbsp;concept of the museum as a&nbsp;constituent and constituted format process that&nbsp;operates within&nbsp;a&nbsp;rhizomatic network of exchange and collaborative production. As a&nbsp;result of this, it becomes possible to begin imagining the Constituent Museum of the future as a&nbsp;model of dispersion and connection as opposed to a&nbsp;model of expansion and colonization.<a href="#sdfootnote35sym" name="sdfootnote35anc"><sup>35</sup></a></blockquote> <p>As Byrne suggests here, the “new” constituent museum has a&nbsp;capacity to challenge and overcome distinctions, hierarchies and exclusions inherent in the “old” modernist model. As already suggested before&nbsp;in the section on institutional critique, instead of breaching the performative framework of art modernist museums simply expanded it by even absorbing their own critique. By establishing links with&nbsp;a&nbsp;diverse group of constituents and users, the new institutions attempt to counter this&nbsp;tendency, democratically negotiating their own hierarchies and transforming their identity.</p> <p>However, the process of democratization is a&nbsp;demanding task, a&nbsp;challenge rather than&nbsp;an accomplishment. Very often, such processes are dependent on a&nbsp;specific agenda of an individual, whose departure might endanger the entire process, like&nbsp;it was in the case of Hudson and MIMA, referenced above. It is an open process, driven by a&nbsp;set of compelling questions, just as frankly stated by the already-quoted Carrillo: “Do art institutions feel addressed and compelled by social demands? Do we have a&nbsp;constituency or just audiences? By whom and how are our addressees identified and defined? What new forms of social engagement should we encourage in order to overcome the insularity of art institutions?”<a href="#sdfootnote36sym" name="sdfootnote36anc"><sup>36</sup></a></p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/11d-1920x-914.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/11d-330x-bc0.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/11d-660x-fe5.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/11d-768x-828.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/11d-1320x-044.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/11d-660x-fe5.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Advertisement for&nbsp;the summit <em>New Abduction of Europe</em>, organized by L'internationale, Museo Reina Sofia and Fundacion de los Comunes, Madrid, 2014</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <p><a href="#sdfootnote36sym" name="sdfootnote36anc"><sup></sup></a></p> <p>To democratize themselves, progressive institutions need to overcome numerous obstacles, such as pressure from&nbsp;the state, municipality, audiences, and market; mistrust or lack of interest from&nbsp;their potential constituents; and the resistance of their own apparatus. For&nbsp;example, when Claire Bishop analyzed Van Abbemuseum as a&nbsp;radical institution, a&nbsp;couple of years prior to the establishment of the Museum of Arte Útil (she analyzed projects of up to 2012), she emphasized the problems that&nbsp;this museum had with&nbsp;making and maintaining links with&nbsp;its audiences, publics or constituencies.<a href="#sdfootnote37sym" name="sdfootnote37anc"><sup>37</sup></a> Manuel Borja, director of Reina Sofia, when recounting various struggles with&nbsp;censorship to which the institution was exposed during&nbsp;the aforementioned exhibition <em>Really Useful Knowledge</em>, has stated that&nbsp;“coercion applied in museums is related to the demands imposed to respond to a&nbsp;prescriptive idea of exactly what the institution is, its responsibilities and to whom it must be addressed.

But&nbsp;such reforms are inconceivable without&nbsp;extra-institutional pressure, exhorted by movements, constituents or collectives. Institutions left to themselves tend to simply replicate their own mechanisms and expand, even if straying from&nbsp;their original mission and ethos. It is not an art-specific failure, but&nbsp;rather an original sin of modern bureaucracies, recurring from&nbsp;the times when Max Weber developed his theory of modern bureaucracy. Art institutions –&nbsp;just as all other institutions –&nbsp;prioritize their own survival and growth. To break this&nbsp;vicious circle, institutions need to establish links with&nbsp;other agents, creating alliances with&nbsp;social movements and other constituencies, which prompt their transformation, potentially evolving into&nbsp;“institutions of the commons”, discussed in detail in the following&nbsp;section.</p> <p>As Charles Esche, director of Van Abbemuseum (VAM), argues in his article on deviant art institutions, revamping institutional remits calls for&nbsp;deviating from&nbsp;the modernist norm.<a href="#sdfootnote43sym" name="sdfootnote43anc"><sup>43</sup></a> This&nbsp;deviation requires institutions to deconstruct and alleviate exclusions fundamental to the bourgeois public sphere, from&nbsp;which all the deviants –&nbsp;people of color, women, proletarians, queer people –&nbsp;have been expelled.<a href="#sdfootnote44sym" name="sdfootnote44anc"><sup>44</sup></a> Particularly relevant in the Netherlands is the shameful legacy of colonialism and the current wave of anti-migration sentiment. Such a&nbsp;democratization process entails interventions in the core operations of the museum, including building and presenting its collection, by prioritizing artworks from&nbsp;non-white, non-European, and non-male artists, thus rebalancing the gender, race and political bias of many Western art collections, including VAM’s. Furthermore, VAM prides itself on having become a&nbsp;platform for&nbsp;discussions on Dutch colonialism, a&nbsp;rallying point for&nbsp;artists and activists of color. Such concerns take central stage in VAM’s public programming, being featured in conferences, research programs and new artistic commissions.</p> <p>When institutions democratize themselves, they need to partially cede their own authority and institutional power, opening up a&nbsp;field of negotiation. This&nbsp;happens when collection departments negotiate their acquisition policies with&nbsp;their constituencies.<a href="#sdfootnote45sym" name="sdfootnote45anc"><sup>45</sup></a> In MIMA, people with&nbsp;experience of migration were consulted when purchasing a&nbsp;piece which would symbolize their flight and they rejected some depictions as misrepresenting their traumatic journeys. In VAM, a&nbsp;community of hip-hop dancers negotiated an acquisition of shoes, property of one of the leading dancers in the scene, a&nbsp;piece of clothing which usually would belong to either an ethnographic (if “exotic” enough) or a&nbsp;design museum. Tensta Konsthall in Stockholm involves its own constituency –&nbsp;mainly migrant communities living in the suburbs of Stockholm –&nbsp;in curatorial and management processes. Such consulting, if approached with&nbsp;the appropriate diligence, blurs the hierarchy of (professional) selectors and (amateurish) audiences. By redefining audiences, who come to museums to look at art, as users, the Museum 3.0 aims to overcome hierarchies embedded in the modernist institution of art –&nbsp;those of authorial or curatorial expertise and a&nbsp;presumed lack thereof amongst audiences, something which riffs on the more general hierarchy that&nbsp;brings together high art and socially embedded creativity. In such instances users become authors, revamping authorial attribution by collectivizing it.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div><section class="u-typo u-typo-media">   <figure class="c-article-figure c-article-figure--right">    <a class="lightbox-item" data-group="articleImages" href="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/13d-1920x-2ca.jpg"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 300px, calc(100vw -&nbsp;30px)" srcset="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/13d-330x-589.jpg 330w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/13d-660x-372.jpg 660w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/13d-768x-26f.jpg 768w,assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/13d-1320x-f9d.jpg 1320w" src="assets/cache/images/issues/2018/20/szreder/13d-660x-372.jpg" alt="" ></a>    <figcaption><p>Advertisement for&nbsp;the summit <em>New Abduction of Europe</em>, organized by L'internationale, Museo Reina Sofia and Fundacion de los Comunes, Madrid, 2014</p></figcaption>   </figure>  </section><section class="u-typo">   <h2>Reality checks</h2> <p></p> <p>For institutional experimentation not to remain in the sphere of unchecked aspirations, institutions need to undergo stress tests embedded in institutional practice. With&nbsp;this idea in mind, Janna Graham and Elliot Perkins formulated a&nbsp;set of guidelines, presented in <em>A Draft for&nbsp;a&nbsp;Blueprint for&nbsp;Change: Propositions and Demands</em> (2018).<a href="#sdfootnote46sym" name="sdfootnote46anc"><sup>46</sup></a> In this&nbsp;document they gathered postulates and criteria, against&nbsp;which institutional practice could be tested to check the progress of its own democratization, while coping with&nbsp;external pressures and the inertia of its own apparatus. Graham and Perkins suggest that&nbsp;institutions should expose the mechanisms of visibility and invisibility used by institutions in their relationships with&nbsp;broader publics; democratize the management of resources, devise engagement practices based on difference; work with&nbsp;a&nbsp;broad base of people to articulate the value of cultural processes and institutions; and question and demonstrate how art can be used for&nbsp;social change. Probably most of the institutions discussed here would face serious challenges in trying to tick all the boxes of such a&nbsp;rigorous institutional stress test. In this&nbsp;sense, the guidelines mark the horizon of aspirations. Graham and Perkins’ text, just like&nbsp;my intervention, implement basic principles of action research in the field of institutional practice. The aim of action research is to reflectively enhance the development of social praxis, including by setting it in a&nbsp;wider context of systemic trends.</p> <p>Here, I&nbsp;propose to interpret instances of progressive institutional experimentation as responses to the dissolution of the modernist institution of artistic autonomy. As Byrne, Carrillo, Graham, Perkins, and many others quoted here suggest, this&nbsp;dissolution entails the debasement of institutional hierarchies. The process of democratization must entail negotiation of authority, otherwise it is purely tokenistic. As Ewa Majewska and I&nbsp;have advocated elsewhere, the answer to the authoritarian challenge is not nostalgia for&nbsp;the eroding autonomy, but&nbsp;rather models of instituting the common which would utilize the powers of art and art institutions for&nbsp;society’s benefit.<a href="#sdfootnote47sym" name="sdfootnote47anc"><sup>47</sup></a> Even though the commons, as a&nbsp;mode of shared usership, which does not entail the private ownership of resources or infrastructures used, it requires appropriate institutional models and legal formulas to facilitate such use. In conclusion to my argument, I&nbsp;propose to consider useful, conspiratorial, deviant museums as attempts to come up with&nbsp;such institutional formulas. Even though the institutions in question only rarely change their statues (they remain state-run or municipal institutions), they attempt to broaden the ways in which they can be used for&nbsp;a&nbsp;common benefit. In the context of art, such institutions of the commons do not abandon the notion of autonomy altogether, but&nbsp;rather use it tactically, to build and secure spaces of freedom and relative safety, in an environment shaped by the twin forces of neoliberal capitalism and authoritarian threat. Following&nbsp;Antonio Negri and Micheal Hardt, it is important not to forget, though, that&nbsp;even capitalist and nationalist enterprises offer corrupted versions of the commons, the main problem being that&nbsp;the ones on offer are based on exploitation and exclusion.<a href="#sdfootnote48sym" name="sdfootnote48anc"><sup>48</sup></a> Just as I&nbsp;have suggested before, the same goes for&nbsp;the value and autonomy of art. Nationalists and capitalists do not simply eradicate them, but&nbsp;instead reassemble them as elements of their own projects.</p> <p>In the case of progressive institutions, the commons offer a&nbsp;horizon of aspiration for&nbsp;transgressing exclusions formative for&nbsp;bourgeois, Western modernity, based on a&nbsp;clear demarcation between&nbsp;state and private, between&nbsp;proper publics and deviating others, between&nbsp;the institutional inside&nbsp;and outside. When institutions such as the Casco Institute of Art in Utrecht recalibrate themselves to work for&nbsp;the commons, they deliberately challenge these boundaries, establishing their own constituent assembly, while reworking its internal procedures and division of labor (for example, the curatorial and administrative staff are expected to take part in maintenance duties, such as cleaning the premises). This&nbsp;is not a&nbsp;frictionless process, as institutions need to seriously engage in processes of institutional unlearning, and rein in their own power. When Museo Reina Sofia tried to establish archives of the commons, as described by Bishop,<a href="#sdfootnote49sym" name="sdfootnote49anc"><sup>49</sup></a> the museum needed to address its own colonial past&nbsp;and current hierarchies. It had to question its own privilege, a&nbsp;privilege which enables richer museums, usually located in capitalist centres, to acquire archives from&nbsp;poorer countries, which lack their own institutional foundations. If left unchecked, such colonial operations impoverish peripheral cultures, precisely as described by Red Conceptualismos del Sur, a&nbsp;bottom-up network of researchers and activists preserving the Latin American legacy of politicised conceptualism.<a href="#sdfootnote50sym" name="sdfootnote50anc"><sup>50</sup></a> To act progressively, institutions like&nbsp;Museo Reina Sofia need to transform their own apparatus, and they do so by establishing a&nbsp;relationship with&nbsp;independent collectives, such as RedCSur. The process of acquisition is reformulated to benefit the commons, as archives are scanned, registered under&nbsp;open licences and stored in publicly accessible libraries, without&nbsp;being moved from&nbsp;the country of origin. The institution and the collective create a&nbsp;temporary yet crucial alliance against&nbsp;economic and cultural colonialism, embedding archives in the public domain.</p> <p>There are many similar examples of cooperation between&nbsp;progressive artistic institutions and self-organized artistic collectives or social movements. None of them unfolds without&nbsp;tensions created at the threshold between&nbsp;institutional hierarchy and radically democratic modes of instituting from&nbsp;below. But&nbsp;as the modernist institution of art crumbles under&nbsp;sustained pressure from&nbsp;financial capitalism and oligarchic authoritarianism, it creates a&nbsp;systemic impulse for&nbsp;both institutional experimentation and artistic self-organization, manifested during&nbsp;political upheavals like&nbsp;occupations and strikes, but&nbsp;also materialising as a&nbsp;plethora of art collectives and networks. In fact, I&nbsp;would argue that&nbsp;future institutions of the commons, operating beyond&nbsp;the eroded boundaries of artistic and institutional autonomy, will emerge as a&nbsp;fusion between&nbsp;social movements and progressive institutions. These institutional assemblages will constitute support structures for&nbsp;more socially useful and democratic forms of art.</p>  </section>  <div class="clearfix"></div>
